marseille , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- the french prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of germanwings flight 9525 insisted wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane . marseille prosecutor brice robin told cnn that `` so far no videos were used in the crash investigation . '' he added , `` a person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators . '' robin 's comments follow claims by two magazines , german daily bild and french paris match , of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board germanwings flight 9525 as it crashed into the french alps . all 150 on board were killed . paris match and bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . the two publications described the supposed video , but did not post it on their websites . the publications said that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . `` one can hear cries of ` my god ' in several languages , '' paris match reported . `` metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . then nothing . '' `` it is a very disturbing scene , '' said julian reichelt , editor-in-chief of bild online . an official with france 's accident investigation agency , the bea , said the agency is not aware of any such video . lt. col. jean-marc menichini , a french gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the germanwings crash site , told cnn that the reports were `` completely wrong '' and `` unwarranted . '' cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they `` had n't been exploited yet . '' menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the criminal research institute in rosny sous-bois , near paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , menichini said . asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , menichini answered with a categorical `` no . '' reichelt told `` erin burnett : outfront '' that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying bild and paris match are `` very confident '' that the clip is real . he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after bild and paris match published their reports . `` that is something we did not know before . ... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , '' he said . what was mental state of germanwings co-pilot ? german airline lufthansa confirmed tuesday that co-pilot andreas lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of germanwings flight 9525 , which he 's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the french alps . lubitz told his lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a `` previous episode of severe depression , '' the airline said tuesday . email correspondence between lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation , lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . the announcement indicates that lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , knew of lubitz 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . lufthansa , whose ceo carsten spohr previously said lubitz was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a `` swift and seamless clarification '' and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . spohr traveled to the crash site wednesday , where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside . he saw the crisis center set up in seyne-les-alpes , laid a wreath in the village of le vernet , closer to the crash site , where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial . menichini told cnn late tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching . french president francois hollande , speaking tuesday , said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using dna analysis by the end of the week , sooner than authorities had previously suggested . in the meantime , the recovery of the victims ' personal belongings will start wednesday , menichini said . among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board . check out the latest from our correspondents . the details about lubitz 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and lubitz 's possible motive for downing the jet . a lufthansa spokesperson told cnn on tuesday that lubitz had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and `` held all the licenses required . '' earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf , christoph kumpa , said medical records reveal lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license . kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . investigators are looking into whether lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a european government official briefed on the investigation told cnn on tuesday . while flying was `` a big part of his life , '' the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told cnn that authorities believe the primary motive for lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . lubitz 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the european government official said . but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said brian russell , a forensic psychologist . `` psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , '' he said . `` but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems . '' germanwings crash compensation : what we know . who was the captain of germanwings flight 9525 ? cnn 's margot haddad reported from marseille and pamela brown from dusseldorf , while laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's frederik pleitgen , pamela boykoff , antonia mortensen , sandrine amiel and anna-maja rappard contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the palestinian authority officially became the 123rd member of the international criminal court on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories . the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague , in the netherlands , where the court is based . the palestinians signed the icc 's founding rome statute in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem , since june 13 , 2014 . '' later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis . as members of the court , palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well . israel and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the palestinians ' efforts to join the body . but palestinian foreign minister riad al-malki , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release . `` indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' judge kuniko ozaki , a vice president of the icc , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians . `` as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine , palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . rights group human rights watch welcomed the development . `` governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said balkees jarrah , international justice counsel for the group . `` what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . the united states also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc , '' the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` palestine . '' while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . '' the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . cnn 's vasco cotovio , kareem khadder and faith karimi contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions , amnesty international alleges in its annual report on the death penalty . `` the dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year , '' said salil shetty , amnesty 's secretary general in a release . `` it is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people 's lives -- putting people to death for ` terrorism ' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence . '' the report , `` death sentences and executions 2014 , '' cites the example of pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in peshawar in december . china is also mentioned , as having used the death penalty as a tool in its `` strike hard '' campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of xinjiang . the annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe , and this year 's edition contains some mixed findings . on one hand , the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22 % on the previous year . at least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014 , compared to 778 in 2013 . amnesty 's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in china , where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret . belarus and vietnam , too , do not release data on death penalty cases . `` the long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions -lrb- worldwide -rrb- , '' audrey gaughran , amnesty 's director of global issues , told cnn . `` a number of countries are closer to abolition , and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015 . -lrb- there are -rrb- signals of a world that is nearing abolition . '' while the report notes some encouraging signs , it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014 . at least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year , an increase of 28 % compared with 2013 . the report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including egypt and nigeria , `` against scores of people in some cases . '' the organization found `` positive developments '' worldwide , with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions . opinion : sharp spike in death sentences . sub-saharan africa , for example , saw a 28 % fall in reported cases , and executions recorded in the middle east and north africa were down 23 % compared to 2013 . `` even though we 've highlighted some of the negative developments ... i think we would always highlight that there are positive developments , '' gaughran said . `` across the board , with the exception of europe and central asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region . '' the resumption of the use of capital punishment in belarus -- the only country in europe and central asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . the united states has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the americas to conduct executions , but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly , from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014 . the state of washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year . the u.s. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment , with only iran -lrb- 289 + -rrb- , iraq -lrb- 61 + -rrb- , and saudi arabia -lrb- 90 + -rrb- executing more people in 2014 . while figures are not available , amnesty estimates that china also executes `` thousands '' of prisoners each year , `` more than the rest of the world put together . '' the report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death . `` in the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards , '' the report stated . `` in 2014 amnesty international raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in afghanistan , bangladesh , china , egypt , iran , iraq , north korea , pakistan , saudi arabia and sri lanka . '' the united nations secretary-general , ban ki-moon , last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment . `` the taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another , '' he said , in marking world day against death penalty in october . `` we must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights . '' amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014 .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- seventy years ago , anne frank died of typhus in a nazi concentration camp at the age of 15 . just two weeks after her supposed death on march 31 , 1945 , the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the jewish diarist had been to surviving the holocaust . but new research released by the anne frank house shows that anne and her older sister , margot frank , died at least a month earlier than previously thought . researchers re-examined archives of the red cross , the international training service and the bergen-belsen memorial , along with testimonies of survivors . they concluded that anne and margot probably did not survive to march 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by dutch authorities . in 1944 , anne and seven others hiding in the amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . anne frank 's final entry . that same year , anne and margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the bergen-belsen camp in germany . days at the camp were filled with terror and dread , witnesses said . the sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting , little water and no latrine . they slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents , according to the researchers . like the other prisoners , the sisters endured long hours at roll call . her classmate , nannette blitz , recalled seeing anne there in december 1944 : `` she was no more than a skeleton by then . she was wrapped in a blanket ; she could n't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice . '' listen to anne frank 's friends describe her concentration camp experience . as the russians advanced further , the bergen-belsen concentration camp became even more crowded , bringing more disease . a deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day . typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene . the disease causes high fever , chills and skin eruptions . `` because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes , anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period , '' museum researchers wrote . they concluded that it 's unlikely the sisters survived until march , because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before february 7 . `` most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear , '' wrote authors erika prins and gertjan broek . the exact dates of death for anne and margot remain unclear . margot died before anne . `` anne never gave up hope , '' said blitz , her friend . `` she was absolutely convinced she would survive .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart iran 's nuclear ambitions , saying he sees better options than `` this bad deal or war . '' `` i think there 's a third alternative , and that is standing firm , ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal , '' netanyahu told cnn 's jim acosta sunday on `` state of the union . '' his comments come as democrats and republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift western sanctions on iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges , limiting its highly enriched uranium , and increasing inspections . president barack obama endorsed the deal , saying it was better than the alternatives . but gop contenders for the party 's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it , saying it gave iran too much flexibility . on sunday , the sparring continued . one senate democrat said netanyahu needs to `` contain himself . '' and a top republican said almost any of obama 's successors as president `` could do better . '' netanyahu 's most recent argument against the iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a march trip to washington , when he addressed a joint session of congress -- fueling a republican push to have the deal sent to congress before it 's implemented . `` it does not roll back iran 's nuclear program . it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place . not a single centrifuge is destroyed . not a single nuclear facility is shut down , including the underground facilities that they built illicitly . thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning , enriching uranium , '' netanyahu said sunday . `` that 's a very bad deal . '' netanyahu said iran is a country of `` congenital cheating '' and that it ca n't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal , which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that . he said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with obama . `` i think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this , because i think iran has shown to be completely distrustful , '' netanyahu said . democratic sen. dianne feinstein of california , meanwhile , said she wishes netanyahu `` would contain himself . '' the top-ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from iran and the united states , as well as russia , china , britain , france and germany -- are `` on the cusp of something that can be workable . '' `` it 's a framework . it has to be wrapped into a final agreement . there still can be some changes , '' feinstein said . `` but i do n't think it 's helpful for israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill , a downhill dynamic in this part of the world . '' energy secretary ernest moniz defended the deal in an appearance on cbs ' `` face the nation '' on sunday , saying it would extend from two months to one year the `` breakout '' time period -- the length of time it would take iran to build a nuclear bomb . he said it also allows for the `` almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal . '' `` we have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb , '' he said . sen. lindsey graham , r-south carolina , said on `` face the nation '' that the best option for the united states is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a `` new crack at it with a new president that does n't have the baggage of obama . '' and he said the alternatives to obama on both sides -- with the exception of sen. rand paul of kentucky , who 's called for a less active u.s. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal . `` hillary clinton would do better . i think everybody on our side , except , maybe , rand paul , could do better , '' graham said .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- police in the indian city of malegaon , in the western state of maharashtra , are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents : cattle . following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef , authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ` mugshot ' of their cattle and submit it to the police . along with the photograph , the residents have to give information about their animal 's ` unique features , ' such as the coloring and age of the cow , along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics . police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law . cows are considered holy and revered by that state 's majority hindu population . `` we are creating a database . if we get an information of a cow slaughter , we can quickly go to the resident 's place and check whether it is there or not '' , mahesh sawai , deputy superintendent of malegaon police told cnn . `` i believe this will be very effective '' so far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed . the ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in malegaon , where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat . the maharashtra animal preservation bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses . even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years . the slaughter of buffaloes , however , is still permissible . however , beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike , which ended wednesday . the traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat . they have now vowed to file a case in the state 's high court . red meat lovers were n't too delighted either , arguing the government does n't have a right to interfere in an individual 's personal preference . maharashtra is not the only indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter . haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison , the toughest penalty in the country . rajnath singh , india 's home minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . on its website , the ncaa prominently states , `` it 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed . '' and later , it says that `` in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second . '' but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes . the lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history . in its response , the ncaa says it has no legal responsibility `` to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions . '' even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the ncaa has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , ncaa attorneys wrote in this court filing that `` the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes , '' and `` the ncaa does not have ` direct , day-to-day , operational control ' '' over member institutions like unc . `` it 's nonsense . it 's double talk , '' said gerald gurney , a former athletic-academic director who is now president of the drake group for academic integrity in collegiate sport . `` if you look at their basic core principles , it 's all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount , '' gurney said . `` they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths . '' the ncaa referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : . the ncaa believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaa 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the ncaa has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field . `` this case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the ncaa to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , '' said donald remy , ncaa chief legal officer . in its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the american bar association or american medical association , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately . the scandal at unc involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports . mary willingham , the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required . the system of eligibility that the ncaa brags about , she says , is a sham . `` why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? it makes no sense , '' said willingham , who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called `` cheated . '' `` if they ca n't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play ? it 's lost its meaning for me . '' the ncaa 's claim that it 's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , mark emmert , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . for example , before it lost a case filed by former ucla player ed o'bannon , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the ncaa stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education . that 's the defense the ncaa is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney jeffrey kessler , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value . in response , the ncaa said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : consistent with `` its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaws . '' attorney michael hausfeld , who represented both o'bannon and now the unc athletes , said this : . `` this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaa 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes . ncaa president mark emmert has repeatedly proposed that ` what we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the ncaa 's record tells a far different story . '' but rick burton , professor of sport management at syracuse university , said it 's not realistic to think that the ncaa would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country . `` i understand , i think , where the ncaa is coming from . we would not let the ncaa come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at syracuse university , '' he said . `` it sounds like someone is trying to say the ncaa should have been supervising that department at the university of north carolina , and there 's no logic to that , '' he said . `` the people who are saying the ncaa should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the ncaa . '' unc , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the `` educational malpractice '' theory does n't apply . unc claims it is protected by state law . this is reminiscent of another ncaa reversal . the ncaa , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from `` dangerous and exploitive athletic practices , '' now says it does not enforce health and safety rules . in fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the ncaa wrote : `` the ncaa denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes . '' a cnn investigation found that the ncaa has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken . it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the nfl . ramogi huma , president of the national college players association , and a leading thorn in the ncaa 's side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the ncaa leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all . `` there 's nothing left the ncaa can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society . one has to wonder what does the ncaa do if it does n't protect players ? if it does n't play a role in the education of college athletics ? it begs the question of why does the ncaa exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption . ''

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenya , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast . somalia-based al-shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenya , the most well-known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in 2013 . cross-border raids into kenya by the group , however , date back to 2011 . al-shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi , which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al-shabaab and other militants for several years . al-shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the koran as al-qaeda and isis -lrb- also known as islamic state -rrb- , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support . its origins lie in al-ittihad al-islami -lrb- unity of islam -rrb- , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of siad barre in 1991 . these disparate groups fought each other and a u.n. peacekeeping mission in the somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later . al-shabaab -lrb- literally `` the youth '' -rrb- split from unity of islam in 2003 and merged with another radical islamist group , the so-called islamic courts union . as their alliance obtained control of somalia 's capital mogadishu in 2006 , ethiopia , the only majority christian country in the region , took military action against the group . the offensive weakened al-shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern somalia , but it failed to defeat it . to the contrary , ethiopia 's invasion and occupation of parts of somalia -- although invited by the somali government and backed by the african union -- enabled al-shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign `` christian '' invasion . initially , the group primarily attacked ethiopian forces , but soon began to `` expand '' its activities against the somali government as well . the first attack outside somalia was an attack in the ugandan capital of kampala in 2010 . soon after this , cross-border raids in kenya began , predominantly targeting christians there . increasing its links with al-qaeda , al-shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to isis . much will depend on how the relationships between al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , a long-time ally of al-shabaab based in yemen , and isis develop . the key point is that al-shabaab 's attack in garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors . it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism . clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of islam . but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance . these entrenched inequalities help al-shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons . attacking a university in northern kenya and separating christian from muslim students epitomizes the way al-shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities . ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources . as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests . it is important to counter al-shabaab directly , including by military means . but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by al-shabaab . as garissa shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit . copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .

' be the hot 100 's no. 1 song of 2015 ? with `` funk '' now just three weeks from potentially tying `` one sweet day '' for the record , and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself , can it rewrite hot 100 history ? it 's too early to forecast charts a month away , but `` funk '' still sports strong leads in all main hot 100 metrics . `` funk '' logs a 13th week atop the digital songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold -lrb- down 12 percent -rrb- in the week ending march 29 , according to nielsen music . that 's a record-tying feat : `` funk ! '' matches flo rida 's 2007-08 hit `` low , '' featuring t-pain , for the most weeks a title has spent at no. 1 on digital songs . `` funk '' also leads streaming songs -lrb- 16.2 million u.s. streams , down 15 percent -rrb- for an 11th week . on radio songs , `` funk '' reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all-format audience -lrb- down 4 percent -rrb- . it 's the first song to reach double-digit weeks at no. 1 on radio songs since `` blurred lines '' led for 11 . ask billboard : will ` uptown funk ! ' be the hot 100 's no. 1 song of 2015 ? `` funk , '' thus , leads the hot 100 and its three main component charts -lrb- digital songs , radio songs and streaming songs -rrb- simultaneously for a record-extending ninth week -lrb- nonconsecutively -rrb- . perhaps helping the chances that `` funk '' can remain at no. 1 on the hot 100 , at least for another week : while it 's down by 11 percent in overall activity , the no. 2 song -lrb- for a third week -rrb- , maroon 5 's `` sugar , '' decreases by 3 percent , while ed sheeran 's `` thinking out loud , '' at no. 3 -lrb- for a third week , after peaking at no. 2 for eight weeks -rrb- , is off by 2 percent . and , the lead of `` funk '' over those songs is still significant : they each boast approximately two-thirds of the hot 100 points of `` funk '' this week . could either `` sugar '' or `` loud '' rebound to challenge `` funk '' further on the hot 100 ? could another song in the top 10 topple it ? or , is it a song just building , or not even yet released , that will take over ? again , it 's too soon to tell . we know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that `` funk '' has become . -lrb- at least we think one will ... -rrb- . chart highlights : taylor swift 's ` style ' hits no. 1 on adult pop songs . meanwhile , `` sugar '' takes over at no. 1 on the subscription services-based on-demand songs chart , despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams . -lrb- `` funk '' falls to no. 3 on the list after 11 weeks at no. 1 . -rrb- `` sugar '' holds at no. 2 on digital songs -lrb- 143,000 , down 8 percent -rrb- ; rises 4-2 on radio songs -lrb- 133 million , up 3 percent -rrb- ; and keeps at no. 4 on streaming songs -lrb- 9.5 million , down 4 percent -rrb- . below sheeran , ellie goulding 's `` love me like you do '' holds at no. 4 on the hot 100 after reaching no. 3 . the fifty shades of grey soundtrack single dips 3-4 on digital songs -lrb- 114,000 , down 14 percent -rrb- and stays at no. 5 on radio songs -lrb- 118 million , up 8 percent -rrb- and streaming songs -lrb- 9 million , up 9 percent -rrb- . from the same hit movie , the weeknd 's `` earned it -lrb- fifty shades of grey -rrb- '' reaches the hot 100 's top five -lrb- 6-5 -rrb- , adding top airplay gainer honors for a second week . on radio songs , it pushes 9-6 with a 23 percent gain to 86 million . `` earned '' -lrb- a possible contender for no. 1 on the hot 100 ... -rrb- holds at no. 6 on both streaming songs -lrb- 8.9 million , up 24 percent -rrb- and digital songs -lrb- 107,000 , up 4 percent -rrb- . the sultry track also takes over at no. 1 on billboard 's hot r&b / hip-hop songs chart . chart highlights : taylor swift 's ` style ' hits no. 1 on adult pop songs . fetty wap 's `` trap queen '' rises 8-6 on the hot 100 , while spending a second week at no. 1 on hot rap songs ; taylor swift 's `` style '' ranks at no. 7 on the hot 100 for a third week after reaching no. 6 -lrb- and , as previously reported , reaches no. 1 on the adult pop songs airplay chart -rrb- ; rihanna , kanye west and paul mccartney 's `` fourfiveseconds '' drops 5-8 on the hot 100 after climbing to no. 4 -lrb- and departs the hot r&b / hip-hop songs summit after seven weeks -rrb- ; and flo rida climbs 10-9 with `` g.d.f.r. , '' featuring sage the gemini and lookas . the rapper 's new ep , my house , arrives tuesday -lrb- april 7 -rrb- . one song is new to the hot 100 's top 10 : la rose 's `` somebody , '' featuring jeremih -lrb- 13-10 -rrb- . the dutch singer 's debut hit lifts 10-8 on radio songs -lrb- 73 million , up 9 percent -rrb- ; backtracks 13-14 on digital songs , but with a 7 percent gain to 68,000 ; and zooms 31-19 on streaming songs -lrb- 4.3 million , up 5 percent -rrb- . the track tops the rhythmic songs airplay chart for a second week . -lrb- jeremih scores his fourth hot 100 top 10 , and first in a featured role . -rrb- . la rose is adjacent to her friend , and mentor , flo rida , on the hot 100 . after she had introduced herself to him at a party , they soon began working together , and she started touring with him . they created `` somebody , '' based on whitney houston 's 1987 hot 100 no. 1 `` i wan na dance with somebody -lrb- who loves me -rrb- , '' as la rose is a `` huge fan of '80s music , '' as she told billboard . she 's currently recording her debut ep . just beyond the hot 100 's top 10 , walk the moon 's `` shut up and dance '' pushes 15-12 , and is the new no. 1 on the hot rock songs chart , while jason derulo 's `` want to want me '' bounds 27-17 . and , rihanna roars in at no. 23 with `` b **** better have my money , '' the chart 's highest debut , powered largely by its no. 5 debut on digital songs -lrb- 108,000 sold since its digital retail arrival on march 26 -rrb- . more details on action below the top 10 in the weekly `` hot 100 chart moves '' column to post on friday -lrb- april 3 -rrb- . see the original story at billboard.com . © 2015 billboard . all rights reserved .

seoul , south korea -lrb- cnn -rrb- the man accused of stabbing u.s. ambassador mark lippert in seoul last month is now charged with attempted murder , a south korean court official said wednesday . kim ki-jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction , the seoul central district court official said . according to south korean law , kim 's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today 's indictment . lippert was stabbed march 5 during an event organized by the korean council for reconciliation and cooperation , which advocates peaceful reunification between north and south korea . shortly before lippert was supposed to give a speech , the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw . the ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches . that wound measured 10 centimeters -lrb- 4 inches -rrb- long and 2.5 centimeters -lrb- 1 inch -rrb- deep , but there was no serious facial nerve damage , said dr. jung nam-shik of the yonsei severance hospital . lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand , but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function . police said kim stabbed lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint south korean-u.s. military drills , which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of north korea . police official yoon myeong-seong told reporters that kim had visited north korea seven times between 1999 and 2007 , and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against lippert . kim , 55 , has a history of unpredictable behavior . in 2010 , he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a japanese ambassador to south korea , according to the yonhap news agency . south korean president park geun-hye condemned the attack . `` this incident is not only a physical attack on the u.s. ambassador , '' she said , `` but an attack on the south korea-u.s. alliance and it can never be tolerated .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- blue bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant . public health officials warned consumers friday not to eat any blue bell-branded products made at the company 's broken arrow , oklahoma , plant . that includes 3-ounce servings of blue bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters o , p , q , r , s or t behind the coding date . the warning by the centers for disease control and prevention does not affect other blue bell ice cream , including other 3-ounce servings , not made at the plant . but blue bell has recalled other products . the company is shutting down the broken arrow facility `` out of an abundance of caution '' to search for a possible cause of contamination . it is the third time blue bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a kansas hospital that served the company 's ice cream . listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital . the cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the broken arrow plant in april 2014 , blue bell said . and , according to the cdc , listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant . the bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically , the cdc said . but they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the kansas outbreak . in a separate outbreak in texas , the cdc did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce blue bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples . none of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections . `` investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to blue bell products is ongoing , '' the cdc said . in early march , in light of the kansas listeria outbreak , blue bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in texas . it later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall . five people were infected and three died in the past year in kansas from listeria that might be linked to blue bell creameries products , according to the cdc . all five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis , the cdc said . at least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with blue bell ice cream before developing the infection . `` we are devastated and know that blue bell has to be and can be better than this , '' paul kruse , blue bell ceo and president , said in a statement . `` quality and safety have always been our top priorities . we are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected . '' the cdc advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away . in a statement on its website , blue bell said `` this recall in no way includes blue bell ice cream half gallons , pints , quarts , 3 gallons or other 3 oz . cups . '' this has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of blue bell creameries , the company said . listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , and primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the cdc . symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches , sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms . in the united states , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year , and approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death . cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters . cnn 's debra goldschmidt , amanda watts and jacque wilson contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a popular chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late chairman mao zedong . bi fujian , who works for state-run china central television , was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the communist party 's early years when he started going off script . `` the communist party , chairman mao . do n't mention that old son of a b *** h . he made us suffer so bad , '' went bi 's improvised lyrics . the other dinner guests burst into laughter . bi later apologized . `` my personal speech has led to grave social consequences , and i feel remorseful for that . i hereby sincerely apologize to the public . as a public figure , i shall learn the lesson from this incident , adhering to strict self-discipline , '' he posted on weibo , china 's twitter-like social media platform . making disrespectful references to china 's leaders in public is considered a taboo in china , even today . and bi 's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country 's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation . the 75-second video clip , seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest , was uploaded on monday . since then , it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside china , although it was still accessible on weibo . it 's unclear when the incident occurred , or what the relationsip was between the camera person and bi . cctv said it would investigate . `` as a cctv presenter , bi fujian 's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences , '' the network said in a statement posted on its weibo account . cctv did not respond to a cnn request for comment . fondly known as `` grandpa bi , '' the 56-year-old tv personality was born and grew up in the mao era . the song bi riffed on was part of a `` red '' peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s . it was popularized during the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by mao -- when china was torn apart by violence and social unrest . the video quickly divided china 's online community . critics said bi , as an influential public figure , deserved a harsh punishment . but others rushed to his defense , arguing that bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip . the video also emerged just a day before the new head of cctv started his job , leading some to wonder if it were a case of `` a new broom sweeps clean . '' mao still divides opinion in china . his giant portrait hangs on beijing 's tiananmen gate , and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in tiananmen square in the heart of the chinese capital . but despite this reverence , mao 's is a deeply flawed legacy . many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear , paranoia and famine , and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths . cnn 's shen lu contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a top al qaeda in the arabian peninsula leader -- who a few years ago was in a u.s. detention facility -- was among five killed in an airstrike in yemen , the terror group said , showing the organization is vulnerable even as yemen appears close to civil war . ibrahim al-rubaish died monday night in what aqap 's media wing , al-malahem media , called a `` crusader airstrike . '' the al-malahem media obituary characterized al-rubaish as a religious scholar and combat commander . a yemeni defense ministry official and two yemeni national security officials not authorized to speak on record confirmed that al-rubaish had been killed , but could not specify how he died . al-rubaish was once held by the u.s. government at its detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba . in fact , he was among a number of detainees who sued the administration of then-president george w. bush to challenge the legality of their confinement in gitmo . he was eventually released as part of saudi arabia 's program for rehabilitating jihadist terrorists , a program that u.s. sen. jeff sessions , r-alabama , characterized as `` a failure . '' in december 2009 , sessions listed al-rubaish among those on the virtual '' ` who 's who ' of al qaeda terrorists on the arabian peninsula ... who have either graduated or escaped from the program en route to terrorist acts . '' the united states has been active in yemen , working closely with governments there to go after aqap leaders like al-rubaish . while it was not immediately clear how he died , drone strikes have killed many other members of the terrorist group . yemen , however , has been in disarray since houthi rebels began asserting themselves last year . the shiite minority group even managed to take over the capital of sanaa and , in january , force out yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi -- who had been a close u.s. ally in its anti-terror fight . hadi still claims he is yemen 's legitimate leader , and he is working with a saudi-led military coalition to target houthis and supporters of former president ali abdullah saleh . meanwhile , yemen has been awash in violence and chaos -- which in some ways has been good for groups such as aqap . a prison break earlier this month freed 270 prisoners , including some senior aqap figures , according to a senior defense ministry official , and the united states pulled the last of its special operations forces out of yemen last month , which some say makes things easier for aqap . cnn 's anas hamdan and merieme arif contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in new york , according to court documents . officer michael rapiejko was with the new york police department from 2003 to 2006 . two years after he left , he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest . the lawsuit said luis colon had parked his car and gotten out when rapiejko , with his gun aimed at colon , ordered him back into the car . during his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration , disorderly conduct and resisting arrest , colon alleged he was yanked from the car , handcuffed and choked . the charges against colon were dropped six months later . colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation , court documents show . colon and the city settled the suit for $ 20,000 . the settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing . rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006 , and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the nypd , a senior law enforcement official told cnn . the nypd has said that it will not release further details about rapiejko . rapiejko 's actions in marana , arizona , in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer , have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used . authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the february incident . the suspect , 36-year-old mario valencia , survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged . marana police chief terry rozema was asked wednesday on cnn 's `` new day '' whether police were fortunate that valencia did n't die . `` that very well may be ... that it 's luck that he is still alive . the fact of the matter remains , though , deadly force was authorized , '' rozema said . `` so if he ends up dying in that situation , -lrb- then -rrb- he ends up dying , and that 's unfortunate , -lrb- but -rrb- that 's not the desire of everybody , '' the chief added . in one of the dashcam videos , an officer who was tailing a walking valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby walmart . another patrol car zooms past , runs into the man from behind , then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway . video from rapiejko 's camera shows the officer 's vehicle running into valencia , with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall . police in marana justified rapiejko 's actions . `` we do n't know that if -lrb- rapiejko -rrb- lets him go for another 10 seconds , -lrb- valencia -rrb- does n't take somebody out in the parking lot , '' rozema said . `` and then we 're answering some completely different questions : ` why did n't you act sooner ? ... this guy had a gun ... why did n't you stop this guy before he shot my wife , before he shot my husband , before he shot my child ? ' '' valencia 's attorney , michelle cohen-metzger , told cnn on tuesday that `` it is miraculous that my client is n't dead . '' `` everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force , '' cohen-metzger said . tucson police sgt. pete dugan told cnn that valencia was involved in several crimes there the day he was struck , including a stealing a car that he drove a half hour north to marana . valencia faces 15 charges , including three counts of aggravated assault , three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor . cohen-metzger said he had a prior record . his next court appearance is may 18 . he is in the pima county jail . marana police on thursday told cnn 's miguel marquez that a store gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered . the wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used , police said . cnn 's tony marco , jason hanna and dominique debucquoy-dodley contributed to this report .

'' about five miles away , the wall of koirala 's hiv/aids hospice has crumbled . home to 115 girls , many of whom are terminally ill , the facility is under guard . `` they 're not injured , but they are terrified , '' koirala said . `` everything is broken in the hospice . '' koirala 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged . `` it 's really very sad for me and for my children , '' koirala said . `` this disaster , the noise and the way it shook , i can not get over it . i was not afraid that i was going to be killed . i was afraid about what is going to happen next . '' another cnn hero , pushpa basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence . they are now living on the ground in a nearby field . `` physically , we are not hurt . but mentally , we are , '' said basnet , whose early childhood development center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated . basnet says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down . she and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse , taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves . `` it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , '' basnet said . `` we are really scared . '' they also do n't have much water or food , basnet says . but she is trying to stay positive . `` i think for the time being , whatever we have , we should be happy , you know ? because at least we have our life , '' she said . '' -lrb- my kids -rrb- all are safe . that 's the most important thing for me . '' basnet 's `` butterfly home '' -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake . basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months , with the opening ceremony set for october . basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 hero of the year . `` when the earthquake hit that land , all my dreams were scattered , '' she said . `` i have to restart again . '' still , basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid . to that end , several cnn heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in nepal . jake wood 's disaster relief organization , team rubicon , has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in kathmandu . the group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city . six canine-firefighter search teams from the united states also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts . the teams were trained by wilma melville 's national disaster search dog foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers , hazmat experts and doctors . tom henderson 's shelterbox , which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies , has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families . dr. laura stachel 's group , we care solar , sent solar suitcases to health care workers , providing them with light and power as they aid survivors . arlene samen 's group , one heart world-wide , has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies , especially in hard-hit districts . robin lim , a disaster response midwife who founded bumi sehat , joined samen in kathmandu to help the mothers . doc hendley 's nonprofit , wine to water , partnered with appalachian state university in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in nepal . the group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly .

' ahead of saturday 's clash at stamford bridge united have been dealt a quadruple injury blow with the news that phil jones , michael carrick , daley blind and marcos rojo will all be unavailable . van gaal though will be able to call on the services of the in-form marouane fellaini . the belgian midfielder has scored twice in united 's last four league games - including a header in their 4-2 derby win over rivals manchester city on april 12 . marcos rojo -lrb- right -rrb- is one of four united players who will miss their league trip to chelsea due to injury . the red devils have in-form midfielder maraoune fellaini -lrb- left -rrb- available for the trip to stamford bridge . fellaini -lrb- right -rrb- scored united 's second goal in their 4-2 win over manchester city on april 12 . and neville believes mourinho may try to nulify the threat of the big belgian midfielder by selecting john obi mikel or kurt zouma in midfield . neville added : ` as for mourinho , will he blink and deploy john obi mikel or kurt zouma in midfield alongside nemanja matic to deal with marouane fellaini in that dangerous united left channel ? ` if he does , how will his team get hold of the ball without the rhythm of cesc fabregas in that deeper role and feed an attack already hit by the loss of diego costa ? i could see united having 60 to 65 % of the ball if mourinho does opt for this solution . ` as a tactic , this would n't ordinarily worry the chelsea manager , but the idea of van gaal going to stamford bridge and not only winning , but also dominating the ball , would maybe open up the wounds of his early encounters with barcelona while coaching real madrid , when the barca purists outplayed and beat his team well . i 'm also pretty sure it would not be something that roman abramovich would enjoy . ` my hope is that they go for each other in a manner which suggests that both feel that they are superior in the football department . ' john obi mikel -lrb- centre right -rrb- could start in midfield for chelsea in a tactic to nullify the threat of fellaini .

ian bell insists england did not underestimate the west indies ahead of the first test , despite some injudicious comments from the incoming chairman of the england and wales cricket board . outgoing yorkshire chairman colin graves , who starts work as giles clarke 's successor next month , upped the stakes before the tour started by declaring the hosts ` mediocre ' and promised ` some inquiries ' if england did not win the series . the west indies hung on for a draw on an unresponsive pitch in antigua last week and the prospect of a similar deck in grenada on tuesday means fulfilling graves ' expectations could be a tough task . ian bell says he never expected england to win the series in the west indies without a struggle . but bell , after 106 tests and 11 years on the international circuit , never expected anything different . ` we 're not in control of those comments -lrb- from graves -rrb- , but we know and respect this west indies side incredibly , ' said the 33-year-old . ' i certainly did n't turn up here expecting for them to roll over and this to be an easy series . you never expect that in any international cricket , let alone a test team . ` i 'm not surprised at all . i expected competition . ` there 's some good young players in that west indies side . we saw the way jason holder played at the end , in a fantastic maiden hundred , and the way jerome taylor bowled , in particular with the new ball , showed we have to play good cricket here . ` do we believe we can win the series ? yes , but there 's a lot of hard work needed to do that . ' bell may have said all the right things but windies opener devon smith , who will become the first grenadan to play test cricket on the island , revealed that graves ' comments had not gone unnoticed . bell scored a magnificent hundred in the first test , but england failed to see out the win . ` they said in the press they would win three to love , that 's the first one down and we 're looking forward to the next two to come , ' he said . ` it motivates me , and the whole team , to go out there and prove them wrong for whatever they said . ` sometimes it 's good to be underdogs . at least you have nothing to lose and something to prove . ` we have no pressure now . england have the pressure because they are looking for the victory . ' there is no doubt that the home team were more content with a shared game at the sir vivian richards stadium and two more draws would be seen as a move in the right direction under new coach phil simmons . that places the onus on england to move the matches forward , but bell believes the west indies are harbouring their own hopes of victory . ` they are out here to beat us . they have had opportunities to put us under real pressure , ' he said . bell was full of praise for jason holder -lrb- right -rrb- who dug in to help save the test for the west indies . ` would we be disappointed if it was 0-0 going home ? yes of course we would . ` in any series we played we would be disappointed not to win it but we are out to do that and hopefully this is the start here and then we go on and finish it in barbados . ` mentally we have to start again . the scoreboards are back on nought and we 've got to work hard for five days to get a result . ' england 's batsmen netted for the first time at the national stadium in st george 's on sunday , though the bowlers were given a rest day following a long day in the field on friday . moeen ali was present , batting and bowling in a bid to prove his fitness following an abdominal injury sustained at the world cup . the all-rounder played one lv = county championship match for worcestershire before being added to the original 16-man squad and looks certain to play in the second test . his presence , probably ahead of james tredwell , would give england 's batting line-up explosive depth down to number eight , with moeen , ben stokes and jos buttler all jostling for position . while the exiled kevin pietersen attempts to force his way back into the test side with surrey , bell is focused on the young talents who are currently wearing the three lions . west indian batsman devon smith admitted his side were inspired by colin graves ' comments . ` mo is a quality batter and a quality bowler so we will have to fit him in somewhere . with joe root , stokes and buttler that is an exciting lower order , ' said bell . ` if we can get off to a good start , they 're going to be worth watching , especially if stokesy plays like he did the other day . ` they 'll give a lot of entertainment over the next few months . to be a senior player in the middle of that exciting young group is a nice place to be .

scientists believe life on earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago . but while they have been able to put a date on when life appeared , they are still far from knowing how it appeared . now researchers in the us and italy say they have evidence that dna-like fragments may have come with ` instructions ' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . scroll down for video . scientists believe life on earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago , but they are still far from knowing how it appeared . now researchers in the us and italy say they have evidence that dna-like fragments may have come with ` instructions ' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . rna , which stands for ribonucleic acid , is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides . it is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life , along with dna and proteins . the main job of rna is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome . this prevents the dna from having to leave the nucleus , and protects it from damage . it also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes . the researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life . the study , by the university of milan and university of colorado boulder , is based on a discovery in the 1980s that rna can chemically alter its own structure . rna is similar to dna , and carries out a number of jobs in our cells , including acting as an on-and-off switch for some genes . scientists believe that when life was in its early stages , rna played a leading role in creating complex organisms before dna and proteins were developed . many origin-of-life researchers say that rna chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions . the new study , however , claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial dna-like fragments evolved in this way instead . the researchers found the self-assembly of dna fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds . these connect together short dna chains to form long ones , without the need for a separate biological process . the image shows a droplet of condensed nano-dna and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left . the liquid crystal droplets act as ` micro-reactors ' where short dna can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life . ` our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early earth when the first dna-like molecular fragments appeared , ' said cu-boulder physics professor noel clark , a study co-author . the study suggests that the way in which dna emerged in the early earth lies in its structural properties and its ability to self-organise . in the pre-rna world , the spontaneous self-assembly of fragments of nucleic acids -- the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self-assembly . ` the new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions , the spontaneous self-assembly of small dna fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers , thereby providing a pre-rna route to the rna world , ' added professor clark .

' anophthalmia is a rare disease in which a baby is born with no eyes . it develops during pregnancy , and affects around one in 10,000 births in the uk . there is sadly no cure . ms davis said : ` the cyst showed up on the 21-week scan and naturally , we were worried about it . anophthalmia means an absence of the eye . a child may be born with one , or both eyes , missing from the eye socket . the rare disorder develops during pregnancy and can be associated with other birth defects . the condition may be caused by genetic mutations and abnormal chromosomes . researchers also believe that environmental factors , such as exposure to x-rays , chemicals , drugs , pesticides , toxins , radiation , or viruses , increase the risk of anophthalmia , but research is not conclusive . unfortunately , there is no treatment that will restore vision in children affected by anophthalmia . children will need to undergo repeated hospital visits and many have prosthetic eyes to ensure that the bone and soft tissue around the eye socket grows properly and to improve appearance . source : the micro and anopthalmic children 's society . ` but none of the doctors said our baby could be born blind . ` everyone has been really supportive and i ca n't thank the doctors and midwives enough for all of their help .

' the news comes after mailonline reported on the story of baby richie , who was also born without eyes , in january . staff at arizona 's banner desert medical center initially thought richie 's face was swollen at birth . but they were stunned to discover the reason his eyelids would not open was because he had anolpthalmia . richie 's mother kelly lopez , from mesa , arizona , is optimistic that science will progress enough to help richie see in his lifetime . baby richie lopez was born with anopthalmia in january . doctors initially thought his face was just swollen .

long the domain of web sites and memes , the animated gif may soon be coming to a message near you . a new app makes creating the images simple on a smartphone - and lets you send them using facebook messenger . camoji is one of the first apps to take advantage of facebook 's decision to open up messenger , revealed at its recent f8 conference in san francisco . camoji allows people to add instagram style filters to their images before sharing them . the gifs are created in the camoji app . once downloaded , users simply tap on the shutter icon to record an animated gif that is up to 2 seconds long . they can then add filters and other effects - similar to instagram . camoji lets you record a gif with unique filters and text and share it to your friends on messenger , where gifs animate inline in the conversation . the gifs are created in the camoji app . people that have camoji installed see a reply button that launches camoji right from the messenger conversation so they can quickly record and send a gif of their own . this type of back and forth is exactly what makes the entire experience beautiful and seamless . ` app discovery is a major challenge for developers , ' said carlos whitt , camoji ceo . ` messenger is opening the door for developers to create innovative new ways for people to connect and express themselves without having to reinvent the social plumbing . ` this is a monumental development . ' ` we 're excited to have worked with the messenger team to help people share by easily capturing moments and sharing them seamlessly within messenger , ' said austin broyles , camoji co-founder . ` we feel our integration is truly unique and innovative . ' this is the first time the world 's biggest social network has opened their messenger app to seamless integration with third parties , and this level of integration does not exist on other messenger apps . camoji had previously integrated with imessage and whatsapp , but those integrations lacked a way for recipients to easily download camoji or launch it from a conversation to reply with another gif . camoji lets you record a gif with unique filters and text and share it to your friends on messenger . earlier this month facebook opened up its messenger service for developers to create apps and for consumers to communicate directly with retailers , in the social media network 's latest effort to expand its reach . the firm hopes to transform facebook 's messaging service into one that operates independently of the company 's social media network , effectively pitting it against traditional email . it even revealed it will allow smart devices such as doors and home appliances to use the platform . it comes as it faces intensifying competition from twitter and google , as well as from fast-growing messaging apps such as snapchat and wechat . facebook unveiled the new features at its annual developer conference in san francisco , for the first time allowing developers to create apps that function inside the messenger app , which has more than 600 million users . forty different apps will be available on messenger in the coming days , allowing users of the service to send each other sports clips and animations , facebook said . users can add text and other effects to their gifs before posting them . another feature will allow consumers to use messenger to send a text message to make a restaurant reservation or to receive a notification that a product purchased online has shipped . ` one of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is messenger , ' said mr zuckerberg . ` facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things , now facebook is a family of apps , ' he said . ` moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we 've made in our strategy in helping connect people . ' the messenger platform was also launched , allowing developers to build new services into the app , which is used by 600 million users each month . mr zuckerberg said it would give users ` more tools for expression ' .

8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . noreen spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal . noreen , then 68 , had the scan as part of the nhs breast cancer screening programme , and as she says : ` as always , getting the all-clear was a big relief . ' but 18 months later , shortly before her 70th birthday , the mother-of-three from derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side , just below her breast . and although noreen , a former administrator , was n't concerned , her daughter , a radiographer , insisted she see a gp . despite finding nothing abnormal , the gp referred noreen for a mammogram . this revealed three lumps on her left breast , which were all tumours . noreen is adamant : ` that gp appointment saved my life . ' breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988 , with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years . in 2000 , the upper limit was extended to 70 . ' i did n't realise it at the time , but at 68 i 'd already had my last official mammogram , ' says noreen . ` it 's all the more scary knowing that , because even though i check my breasts regularly , i definitely had n't felt any lumps . without my daughter , i would n't have gone to my gp . ' noreen was one of the lucky ones . mps are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit . in a report published two weeks ago , the all party parliamentary group on breast cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . and while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70 . so , extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved , the mps said . in fact , the upper age limit is due to change . from the end of 2016 , all women up to 73 will be invited for screening . but critics argue this is not high enough . nat lievesley , a researcher at the centre for policy on ageing , says this cut-off point ` seems arbitrary ' , adding : ` it feels like a decision based on cost rather than what 's best for women . ' and the parliamentary group is concerned at the ` slow pace of change ' . in 2013 , they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76 , and possibly to 79 . ` extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved ' ` while some progress has been made , there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care , treatment and support most appropriate to them , ' says steve brine , the conservative mp for winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group . and this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms . there 's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women . in 2013 , researchers at the university of sussex said women over 70 in the uk who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients . a study from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , published in the british journal of cancer , reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in sweden , where screening in most of the country continues to 74 . sean duffy , national clinical director for cancer at nhs england , last year warned : ` around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in england if survival rates matched the best in europe . ' it is ` shameful ' to write off people as too old for screening and treatment , adds lynda thomas , chief executive of macmillan cancer support . ` people should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age . ' ending screening at 73 ` does n't take account of the fact that ageing is changing ' , adds nat lievesley . ` it 's no longer a strong indicator of frailty . just look at the role models for women in their 70s . ' yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut , for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment . a dutch study , published in the bmj in august 2014 , suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in ` over - diagnosis and overtreatment ' . researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995 , when breast cancer screening in the netherlands was extended from 69 to 75 . they found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer , while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably . for every woman found to have advanced cancer , another 20 would be diagnosed with small , slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy . lead researcher dr gerrit jan-liefers , of leiden university medical centre , said : ` the chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women . ' older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer , he pointed out . ` so it may take them a year , a year and a half before they function normally . ' for noreen spendlove , however , there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended . after her second mammogram in march 2011 , she had a needle biopsy the same day , and two weeks later a mastectomy . the cancer had spread to her neck , so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy . ` the treatment was murderous , ' says noreen . but as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year , she has no regrets about having this treatment . indeed , her worry is that , once five years since her treatment have passed , she 'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be . in fact , women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it 's just the invitations that stop . cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer . women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . an added complication is that older women are likely to be less ` breast aware ' and more cautious about bothering their gp , the all-party parliamentary group pointed out previously . jane murphy , clinical nurse specialist at breast cancer care , says : ` it 's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they are n't being invited , they are no longer at risk . ' jackie woods , 57 , a local government officer from forest hill , south london , agrees this can be a problem . her mother , betty , celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago . betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms , despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so . during november 2011 , jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram . the diagnosis reminded betty to request another scan for herself , and in june 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy . rather than simply ending screening , the dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good , say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman . this should be ` based on remaining life expectancy , breast cancer risk , functional status and patients ' preferences ' , says dr jan-liefers . another way forward , says jane murphy , is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones . ` they should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening . but it does n't always happen . ' noreen spendlove was given no such card . ` it 's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up , ' she says . breast cancer care helpline : 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk . macmillan cancer support : 0808 808 0000 or macmillan.org.uk .

love the lighting in these photography shots ? they become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they 're paintings , and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them . patrick kramer is a 33-year-old artist hailing from springville , utah , who specialises in remarkably hyper-realistic paintings . scroll down for video . action shot : the artwork of 33-year-old patrick kramer is so realistic it 's impossible to tell apart from a photo . in this image , he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . the us artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits , including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called matt . the paintings , including this of a sleeping young girl called anna , take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . it 's almost impossible to tell that kramer 's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity . his portrayals vary between vivid city scenes , still-life objects , portraits and breathtaking motion-shots . as well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings , he also constructs more surreal variations on still life , involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background . one of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician drake 's 2013 album , nothing was the same . kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots , which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . his technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . the us artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas . this allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing , which appear almost three-dimensional in the pieces of artwork . kramer has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours -lrb- one to six weeks -rrb- to complete . the length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail . the 33-year-old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality . kramer also constructs more surreal imagery of insects , which all still have the same high level of detail - including -lrb- left -rrb- a dragonfly on an intricate background , and -lrb- right -rrb- kramer 's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters . cracks in the surface : the artist , from utah , specialises in creating exceptionally-realistic works of art . in this case , it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint . kramer said : ` being a perfectionist , i have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality . the artist 's background and education was also important in honing his interests . ' i studied painting in college , and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft . ' i never intended to pursue the style , but found it hard to give up , as it suited my nature . ' kramer 's artwork - including this painting of half-filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity . glass half full or half empty ? this painting is incredibly detailed , from the fine fish fins to the bubble floating at the top of the glass . kramer 's paintings can vary between still-life of subjects such as paint-brushes -lrb- left -rrb- and detailed portrayals , such as this harbour -lrb- right -rrb- . nothing was the same : this painting imitates the album cover art for drake 's 2013 album , but swaps drake for a female model .

many of whom are from other african countries - have largely subsided in the country 's east where the violence began . with unemployment and poverty levels high in the country , some south africans have accused the immigrants of taking jobs and opportunities away from them . a police spokesman said the 30 people arrested in johannesburg overnight will be charged for ` public violence , malicious damage to property , house breaking and theft ' . thousands of foreigners in the country have fled their homes and the country amid the violence , escaping to makeshift camps as well as neighbouring countries like zimbabwe , malawi and mozambique . the surge of violence against immigrants is widely blamed on a speech made by king goodwill zwelithini , a traditional zulu leader who blamed the foreigners living south africa for its high crime rate and said they must ` take their bags and go ' . he has been accused of ` igniting ' the zulus who comprise one of south africa 's largest ethnic groups by saying ` we must deal with our own lice ' in a speech broadcast by a local radio station . the king has since said his words were misinterpreted but for some , zwelithini simply articulated what many were feeling . protest : south african demonstrators have taken to the streets in johannesburg in a bid to raise awareness of the xenophobic attacks taking place in its township . furious : and in neighbouring mozambique , hundreds have been protesting the violence being inflicted on their countrymen in south africa . safety : as people in maputo , mozambique -lrb- pictured -rrb- protest against the violence in south africa , its government has offered to evacuate its citizens from the country . rise up : mozambique nationals -lrb- pictured -rrb- are furious at the violence against their citizens in johannesburg were four people were killed in a week where shops owned by foreigners were looted back in january . blame : protesters in mozambique -lrb- pictured -rrb- hold up signs blaming south african president jacob zuma for the violence befalling immigrants in the country . demonstrators : some south africans -lrb- pictured -rrb- have tried to raise awareness for the xenophobic violence but some blame the immigrants for taking jobs in a time of severe unemployment . armed : at least six people have died since south africans wielding machetes and other weapons -lrb- pictured -rrb- began attacking and looting properties owned by fellow africans . brutal : the surge of violence against immigrants is widely blamed on a speech made by a traditional zulu leader who blamed foreigners for a rise in hate crime . response : police in johannesburg -lrb- pictured -rrb- have been firing rubber bullets to subdue the violent gangs in the city . battle : a south african police officer trains his sights on zulu protesters who were demonstrated in front of their hostel in the jeppestown district of johannesburg -lrb- pictured -rrb- . retaliation : but police also claim that attacks on immigrants - many of whom are from other african countries - have largely subsided . the violence has also been blamed on high unemployment and while recent figures put it at 25 per cent , economists believe it is much higher and crippling the country with widespread poverty and a glaring class divide . meanwhile foreign nationals have condemned south africa 's police for failing to protect them and even stirring hostility . the government says it is addressing complaints about undocumented migrants but many foreign nationals are living legally in south africa and contributing to economic development . but the situation has become so severe that the government of malawi has hired buses to repatriate 500 of its nationals , according to the country 's information minister . kenya has also offered to evacuate any of their citizens who feel threatened and on just today , mozambique has temporarily blocked a road leading to south africa . 60 people died during similar unrest in the country in 2008 and in january this year , four people were killed in a week where shops owned by foreigners were looted in soweto , johannesburg . furious : a terrifying woman covered in black soot -lrb- pictured -rrb- began screaming at a group of foreign nationals in johannesburg . savage : rioters have armed themselves with sticks , knives and baseball bats as they attack immigrants in johannesburg -lrb- pictured -rrb- . rioters : the violence in south africa has also been blamed on high unemployment and a glaring class divide . vicious : with a total population of about 50 million , south africa is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants who are now being targeted by brutal gangs -lrb- pictured -rrb- . zimbabwe 's information minster jonathan moyo tweeted that ` xenophobia today can easily mutate into genocide tomorrow ' adding that the zulu king should ` extinguish what he ignited ' . while in somalia 's capital of mogadishu , some locals believed their countrymen would have been safer in their troubled native country than in south africa . one resident of the city said : ` this must become a lesson for them to return home ... otherwise , they will be eliminated one by one . '' it is also a major destination for asylum seekers and currently houses more than 300,000 of them according to projections by the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees . with a total population of about 50 million , south africa is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants from countries including somalia , ethiopia , zimbabwe and malawi .

a respected women 's institute president has been convicted after raiding the bank account of her dying life-long friend . kathleen bailey , 70 , a church elder and avid charity fundraiser , was given power of attorney over her terminally ill 87-year-old friend 's finances . bailey later became a carer for her victim , who was battling breast cancer and had no children . but the grandmother , from ramsbottom , greater manchester , helped herself to at least # 1,500 and used the money to finance trips to north wales . kathleen bailey -lrb- pictured -rrb- was given a suspended jail sentence after admitting stealing from her dying friend 's bank account . she was handed a 12-month suspended jail sentence after admitting a charge of theft at bolton crown court . she was also ordered to pay # 1,500 to her victim 's estate . the court heard her victim had persuaded bailey to take power of attorney , giving her control of the sick friend 's financial affairs . she had used the power properly at first to ensure her friend was looked after in a care home in bury and enjoyed days out . but she then ` overstepped the mark ' , according to the prosecution , when she helped herself to cash from her friend 's account . officials at natwest bank in ramsbottom suspended the account when they noticed increasingly large sums of money being withdrawn from october 2012 . over a three-month period , # 800 , # 880 and # 1,100 was taken out in successive transactions . the police arrested bailey at her home in ramsbottom - and her victim died eight weeks later . before her death , she told officers she had been happy for her friend to treat herself , the court heard . colin buckle , defending , said the pair had been life-long friends and that bailey had become her elderly friend 's carer , and had also taken her away on holidays as well as carrying out daily chores . the defendant ` still misses her friend ' , he said . she was handed a suspended jail sentence after admitting a charge of theft at bolton crown court -lrb- pictured -rrb- . but the prosecution said bailey ` overstepped the mark ' and took at least # 1,500 for herself although the exact figure was not known . ` when she found out her friend of 70 years had betrayed her trust she was devastated . ' after the hearing , a member of the victim 's family - who believe bailey stole as much as # 10,000 - said : ' i am absolutely shocked and appalled how anybody could do this to such a caring , loving lady , especially when she was in such poor health , fighting terminal cancer . ` when she found out that kathleen bailey had betrayed her trust and stolen her savings which were paying for her nursing care , she was devastated . ` she told me it was n't just the money , it was the fact that her best friend of 70 years and whom she relied on in her ill health had betrayed her trust . ` she had been such a strong lady , but her confidence was so severely knocked that within a few weeks , she had lost her 12-year battle with cancer . ' a friend blasted bailey 's ` shameless crime ' , adding : ` the money that the victim had was being used to pay for her care . she thought at first that it had all gone . ` she was devastated by the breach of trust . they were close friends for years and she treated her as a daughter . it 's an awful thing to do to a dying woman . she was a lovely women who was very generous . ' bailey 's solicitor helen vaughan added : ' i have absolutely no doubt kathleen bailey intended no harm or wrong towards her friend . ' bailey was president of the shuttleworth-in-ramsbottom women 's institute and a well-known church elder at dundee united reformed church . she was also involved in a number of charities and organisations , including ramsbottom fire cadets .

the former head of the nhs warned labour yesterday that its failure to match tory pledges to invest in the health service would leave it in a ` financial hole ' . sir david nicholson is the latest expert to warn that ed miliband 's plans will not provide enough cash to keep the service going . he was branded the ` man with no shame ' after refusing to resign over the mid staffs scandal which led to 1,200 needless deaths . sir david : the former head of the nhs 's criticism of labour threatens to demolish its claim to be the champion of the nhs . published in the daily mail , february 7 , 2013 . the lifelong bureaucrat had led the west midlands strategic health authority , which oversaw mid staffs , before labour appointed him to run the nhs in 2006 . sir david stayed in the top job , insisting he did not know what went on at mid staffs , until retiring in april last year with a pension pot worth almost # 2 million . his replacement as chief executive simon stevens drew up a # 30billion five-year rescue package called forward view which the conservatives and lib dems have both pledged to implement . it involves the nhs finding # 22billion in savings but also needs an extra # 8billion funding by 2020 . labour has paid lip service to the plan , promising just # 2.5 billion . sir david said : ` all of the parties now i think , bar labour , have signed up to the # 8billion so it 's important , obviously , we get all the political parties signed up . ` they have n't said the # 8billion , it would be helpful , i think , for the nhs if they did . ' his comments add to a chorus of criticism over labour 's health plans . mike dixon , a leading gp and chairman of the nhs alliance , said he was ` extremely worried by the lack of political consensus around the # 8billion funding ' . he added : ` nhs leaders have been clear that this is the minimum amount needed to maintain current service provision . it 's not rocket science to predict the impact on the nhs if this commitment is not met . ` patients would face longer waits , services would face severe cuts and rationing , and many hospitals and gp practices would struggle to survive in their current form . ' health secretary jeremy hunt said labour must explain why it wo n't find the money the nhs ` says it needs ' chris ham , chief executive of the king 's fund think-tank , said : ` the big question is about funding , with labour the only one of the three main parties not to have pledged to find the # 8billion in additional funding called for in the nhs five-year forward view . ` given this is the minimum if the nhs is to continue to meet patient needs and maintain standards of care , this leaves a significant gap at the heart of its plans . ' health secretary jeremy hunt said : ` labour must explain why they wo n't find the money the nhs says it needs . ` they do n't have a plan for the economy and that means they 'll never be able to fund the nhs . ' sir david warned that the scale of the impending cash crisis was so great that the tories and lib dems would have to rein in plans to expand services , despite being committed to the # 8billion . his criticism of labour threatens to demolish its claim to be the champion of the nhs . the party has run a controversial poster campaign claiming the conservatives would cut the nhs ` to the bone ' . but senior figures have confirmed that labour would not match tory spending plans . shadow health secretary andy burnham said a planned shake-up of nhs services by labour meant the ` funding gap ... may be smaller ' .

after a heavy night of drinking , your immune system is bound to be weaker . this is because your body is under oxidative stress - a process that can also happen after smoking , breathing in pollution and even sunbathing . now , for the first time , researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin e , found in foods such as kale and almonds , can mitigate the stress on immune cells . after a heavy night of drinking , your immune system is bound to be weaker . now , for the first time , researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin e found in foods such as kale -lrb- left -rrb- and almonds , can mitigate the stress on immune cells . whenever a virus or other pathogen enters our bodies , a certain class of immune cells - the t cells0 jump into action , spreading rapidly . one sub-class of these cells , the cd8 + t cells , eliminate the virus by killing cells it has infected . other t cells , known as cd4 + t cells , coordinate the immune response to all kinds of pathogens . but a week can pass before these t cells start to take their toll on a virus . and with cells dividing every eight to twelve hours , it takes a few days to gather a strike force of cells in the hundreds of thousands : enough to overwhelm the infection . but this immune response does not work if significant oxidative stress is damaging the t cells and depriving the body of the tools it needs to repair them , according to a new study . a white blood cell , also known as a t cell , carries special structures on its surface with which to recognise specific pathogens . if the immune cells lack repair enzyme gpx4 , the t cells die off as they divide , which means the immune system becomes weak and the infection can be chronic . this is the enzyme responsible for repairing oxidative damage to the cell membrane . your body constantly reacts with oxygen as you breathe and your cells produce energy . as a consequence of this activity , highly reactive molecules are produced known as free radicals . free radicals interact with other molecules within cells . this can cause oxidative damage to proteins , membranes and genes . oxidative damage has been implicated in the cause of many diseases , such as cancer and alzheimer 's and has an impact on the body 's aging process . external factors , such as pollution , sunlight and smoking , also trigger the production of free radicals . source : netdoctor . when testing mice whose immune cells lacked the repair enzyme , researchers led by manfred kopf , a professor at eth zurich , were able to save the immune cells by mixing a high dose of vitamin e into the animals ' food . that was enough antioxidant to protect the t cells ' cell membranes from damage , so they could multiply and successfully fend off the viral infection . at 500 milligrams per kilogram of mouse feed , this quantity of vitamin e was ten times higher than was present in their normal food . ` the benefit of vitamin tablets is a controversial topic , ' says kopf . with little scientific evidence as yet making a strong case for vitamin supplements , he felt their study was all the more interesting because it proved the effectiveness of vitamin e. ` our work shows that even a genetic defect in a major part of a cell 's antioxidative machinery can be compensated for by delivering a high dose of vitamin e . that is new and surprising . ' what kopf is n't yet sure of is what impact the results of their study will have on human health . he claims that people with a normal level of health and a balanced diet should n't need vitamin supplements . but he added a supplement of vitamin e or other liposoluble antioxidants could well make sense in the event of oxidative stress , which can arise in everyday situations such as an infection or exposure to sunlight .

just weeks after he controversially banned meat products from being sold at the sydney opera house during his upcoming shows there , morrissey has once again weighed into australian animal rights issues . the singer , who will be performing four sold-out shows as part of the sydney vivid live festival in may , has written a public letter to the just group imploring them to cease their use of angora wool . the australian retail giant , who own just jeans , portmans , dotti , peter alexander , jacqui e , and jay jays , have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur . warning : graphic content . new campaign : morrissey has written a letter to australian retailer the just group imploring them to stop the use of angora wool . brutal : peta have successfully petitioned a number of australian and international retailers to stop selling angora wool after revealing the horrific treatment of rabbits at chinese angora farms . peta australia has been petitioning the just group to reconsider their position after successfully getting other retailers , including david jones , myer , sportsgirl , general pants co , and jeanswest , to stop selling angora . ` i 'm looking forward to my concerts at the sydney opera house in may , but i was extremely dismayed to learn from my friends at peta australia that the just group refuse to modernise and drop angora wool from their clothing lines ' , morrissey writes . ` by selling angora wool , you 're sending the message to millions of shoppers that your company condone the barbaric abuse and slaughter of rabbits and are willing to perpetuate it . ' refusal : the just group , who own just jeans , portmans , dotti , peter alexander , jacqui e , and jay jays , have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur . stance : the retailer has previously issued a statement on the controversy , simply saying : ` although we are not able to join the pledge sought , i want to thank you for your interest in our group ' the singer , 55 , added that he would post petitions for concertgoers to sign at information booths throughout the opera house if the company did not reverse their decision . globally , major fashion chains including zara , h&m , marks & spencer , and gap have all pledged to not use the fur in recent years after peta outed the heartbreaking conditions of angora rabbits . the organisation revealed the treatment of rabbits on angora farms in china , where workers rip the fur from live rabbits ' skin . peta alleges that the rabbits ` scream in pain ' during the process . the just group are yet to respond to daily mail australia 's request for comment , however a spokesperson has previously responded to peta with the statement : ` although we are not able to join the pledge sought , i want to thank you for your interest in our group . ' in february , morrissey made headline when he ordered all food and bar outlets linked to the opera house 's concert hall remove meat products from their menus for the duration of his residency . additionally , the former smiths singer , who has been a non-meat eater since the age of 11 , ordered that only vegetarian food be served backstage at the venue . protest : morrissey , 55 , pledged to set up petition booths for attendees at his sydney concerts to sign if the just group do not comply . the irish-born star , who says he sees ` no difference ' between eating animals and paedophilia , they are both rape , violence , murder , - will take to the stage during the festival of light and music on the 26th , 27th , 30th and 31st of may . morrissey has never been shy about his views on meat eaters and has categorically said ` if i 'm introduced to anyone who eats beings , i walk away . ' he briefly walked off-stage at coachella in 2009 , complaining about the smell from the nearby food concession area , saying ` the smell of burning animals is making me sick ' . last month he banned burgers and hot dogs from belfast 's the odyssey arena for his performance . and he recently ditched a scheduled concert in iceland when the venue refused to grant his no meat requests the night of his gig . in concert : the irish-born musician has also banned the sale of meat products at the opera house for the duration of his residency for the vivid festival in may . last year , during a q&a session on his fan site , true to you , he replied to a groupie 's question saying : ' i see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia ... ` imagine , for example , if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you `` hello , i enjoy bloodshed , throat-slitting and the destruction of life , '' well , i doubt if you 'd want to exchange phone numbers . ' in another post , he wrote of tv chef jamie oliver : ` if jamie ` orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why does n't he stick one of his children in a microwave ? ' the animal activist is equally known for his outspoken political views and hatred of the british monarchy . he once said in an outspoken interview in 1984 of former british prime minister margaret thatcher : ` she is only one person . she can be destroyed . it is the only remedy for this country at the moment . ' british police responded by searching morrissey 's home and carrying out an official investigation . daily mail australia have contacted the just group for comment .

a family claim they were forced to sit in vomit aboard a united airlines flight after staff refused to clean an affected area of floor before take-off . scott shirley , his wife mayo and seven-year-old son phoenix , were travelling back to washington dc after a birthday trip to disney world , orlando , when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew . after boarding the plane , the shirleys were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet . scroll down for video . mayo shirley , son phoenix , and husband scott were forced to sit in seats surrounded by vomit on a united airlines flight . after putting their luggage on the floor of the cabin , the family discovered the bags to be wet with vomit . mr shirley told mailonline travel : ` my wife decided to transfer her backpack with all our snacks in it to the spot where my son was sitting . it was then , that she noticed her bag was wet . ` she then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet . when she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid , that 's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit . ` given my wife suffers from mysophobia -lrb- phobia of germs -rrb- , she immediately had a look of panic on her face and loudly pronounced it to be vomit . ' i immediately had a feeling of being grossed out that i too had had my hands all over this vomit . my wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind . ' i told the flight attendant what had happened and she directed us both to the available bathrooms . ' the shirley 's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items . mr shirley says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area , and that staff had cleaned the area . ` it was clear that no one had cleaned the area where we were sitting , because there was no evidence of any chemical smell what so ever , ' he added . ` this was purely that distinct smell of vomit on our hands and backpacks . ' mr shirley described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking , and they were given two options by united staff ; fly out next day or remain in their seats . because mrs shirley had to go to work next day at the food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- , the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats . the family were flying back on a united airlines flight from orlando to washington -lrb- file photo -rrb- . however , staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area , and the passengers were given blankets , which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell . mr shirley said : ` the pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made . he told us we had to make a decision because he ca n't delay the other passengers . ` it was at this point i felt as if they could n't care less about the disgusting situation they had put us in and only cared about moving the flight along . i told my wife that we should just take the next day flight . ` she said it is n't an option for her due to her position with the fda and the nine days she had already been on holiday . since we really had no choice in the matter , under duress of the situation , we agreed to the blanket option . ' the family were given trash bags by the airline to put their luggage in . ` it was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family , ' added mr shirley . ' i felt that we had to explain what happened to every person who stared awkwardly at us . this was the final straw for me . ` we went straight to united customer service who told us they ca n't do anything because it involves bags and we would have to go to baggage claim to speak with a supervisor there . this was on the other side of the airport which meant we had to now lug all this stuff there . no assistance was offered . ' with their luggage still bagged up , mr shirley says united airlines have offered them a $ 150 flight voucher each and some ` mileage points ' a spokesperson for united airlines told mailonline travel : the situation mr shirley described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences , as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure . ` we offered them an alternate flight , but they decided to remain onboard . our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate mr shirley and keep the flight on time . ` we 're reaching out to apologise for his experience . ' the family were offered a $ 150 flight voucher , or the option to file a claim for the baggage , which they chose to do . upon returning home , united has offered the each member of the family a $ 150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for mrs shirley . however , mr shirley said : ' i personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell . ' i do n't know what the lasting effects are going to be of this experience . we have to fly at least two more times later this year for weddings and i 'm beginning to think the train might be an option . ' i felt so uncomfortable the whole time we were flying . all i could think about is what this vomit might have in it and if there was anything we would contact from it . '

former american president ronald reagan asked mikhail gorbachev for help from russia to ` fight the alien invader ' . the president and former actor went off-script during a peace summit in geneva in the 1980s to ask the soviet leader for his support in the event of an invasion from extra terrestrial life . reagan repeated the warning when he spoke to a group of students , and his subsequent speeches were examined by his advisers to remove any mention of aliens in them . ronald reagan -lrb- right -rrb- met mikhail gorbachev -lrb- left -rrb- for the first time at a peace summit in geneva , switzerland in 1985 and asked for his support in the event of an alien invasion . the warning was revealed in a book about ufos by dr david clarke , which examines the extent to which americans believed in stories about aliens . he suggests his words may show that reagan , who was inspired by science fiction movies , saw there could have been a threat from aliens . the president is believed to have become an avid science fiction fan while working in hollywood as a b movie actor and was said to be addicted to films like the day the earth stood still and close encounters . he confessed his favourite story was ` the invasion from outer space that prompts earthlings to put aside nationalistic quarrels and band together to fight the alien invader ' . reagan even arranged a private screening of stephen spielberg 's close encounters of the third kind at the whitehouse in 1982 for top judges , astronauts and other vips . in 1985 he went a step further and directly addressed gorbachev at a summit to ask for his support in the event aliens were to invade . ronald reagan asked mikhail gorbachev for support fighting a future alien invasion at a peace summit . ` he surprised gorby by saying he was sure the two superpowers would co-operate if earth was threatened by alien invasion , ' dr clarke said . ` taken aback , the soviet leader politely changed the subject . ' reagan apparently then told his inner circle he felt he had ` scored a point ' over his counterpart . deputy national security adviser colin powell was said to be horrified by the mention of aliens at the meeting . he then found reagan repeated the story to a group of maryland high school students after his return to the us in 1985 . powell 's solution was to go through the president 's public speeches deleting ` interplanetary references ' right until reagan 's final months in office . dr clarke said that at any mention of an alien invasion powell would roll his eyes and say ` here come the little green men again . ' the book suggests reagan was secretly appalled by nuclear weapons and his approach to gorbachev may have been inspired by the 1951 movie , the day the earth stood still . in the film , an interplanetary peace-keeping force lands on earth using an invincible giant robot to force the warring nuclear powers to put aside their differences . dr clarke said : ` for a generation that lived in fear of the bomb , this message of salvation from the stars , delivered by technological angels , was a welcome alternative to the cold war stalemate . ` ronald reagan was a born-again christian and saw no contradiction between his faith and a belief in aliens . ' mikhail gorbachev , pictured in germany in november 2014 , was said to be shocked by reagan 's request . dr david clarke , who wrote how ufos conquered the world , said reagan appeared to believe in aliens . dr clarke said the president may also have been convinced he was speaking for the american public because of a poll released , shortly after close encounters hit film screens . according to a gallup poll , 57 per cent of americans believed that ufos were real , compared to 27 per cent of the british population . seven per cent claimed to have actually seen one . dr clarke added : ` ronald reagan is remembered for his warnings about the danger posed by the `` evil empire '' by which he meant the soviet union . the former us president was said to be obsessed with science fiction films like close encounters . ` but he was also obsessed with science fiction movies - in particular the day the earth stood still - and his comments to gorbachev at the 1985 summit in geneva imply that he might have believed the real threat came not from behind the iron curtain but from hostile extra-terrestrials . ` he was n't the first world leader to suggest that the nations of the earth would only unite in the face of a common foe from outer space . ` in 1947 , just a couple of months before the roswell incident , the british foreign secretary anthony eden - who was to become prime minister in 1955 - said he feared the world would only be united when we `` find someone in mars to get mad against . '' ' dr clarke 's book , how ufos conquered the world , is due to be released next month .

' highlights of the video include large , bright tendrils extending outward from the sun 's surface and occasionally crashing down again - known as solar prominences . other fantastic sections show bright , active regions on the sun 's surface as magnetic fields send it into turmoil . transits of the moon , venus and earth across the sun , as observed from the sdo , are also seen , while towards the end of the video comet lovejoy can be seen passing the sun in december 2011 . another incredible part of the video shows ` coronal rain ' streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun 's surface . coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun 's atmosphere - cools and condenses in strong magnetic fields . the plasma is attracted to the magnetic fields and condenses , slowly falling back to the solar surface over several hours . nasa 's solar dynamics observatory -lrb- sdo -rrb- , illustrated below , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since . it 's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around earth . by watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona , which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun , what heats the sun 's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface , and why the sun 's magnetic fields are constantly on the move . sdo also measures fluctuations in the sun 's extreme ultraviolet output , which provides the majority of energy for heating earth 's upper atmosphere . five years into its mission , sdo continues to send back tantalizing imagery to incite scientists ' curiosity . for example , in late 2014 , sdo captured imagery of the largest sun spots seen since 1995 as well as a torrent of intense solar flares . another incredible part of the video shows ` coronal rain ' -lrb- pictured -rrb- streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun 's surface . coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun 's atmosphere - condenses and falls back to the surface . elsewhere , solar flares and coronal mass ejections -lrb- cmes -rrb- are seen erupting on the sun 's surface , sending out huge amounts of energy . cmes are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun , and they can pose a threat to satellites in earth orbit . solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun , which are sometimes associated with cmes - although their connection is not well understood . the video , though , is a reminder of just how beautiful , powerful and active our solar system 's only star can be . by watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona , which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun , what heats the sun 's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface .

the families of five chinese feminists detained by police for more than a month facing charges of ` picking quarrels and provoking trouble ' have issued a plea to authorities for their release . the female activists were arrested the weekend before international women 's day , as they were preparing to hand out leaflets about sexual harassment on public transport . the five women - li tingting , 25 , wei tingting , 26 , wang man , 32 , zheng churan , 25 , and wu rongrong , 30 - have been linked to several stunts over the last few years which aim to highlight issues such as domestic violence and the poor provision of women 's toilets in china . the chinese feminist activists -lrb- all pictured -rrb- have been detained by police for more than a month and face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged with ` picking quarrels and provoking trouble ' they now face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged . prosecutors will announce later today whether the women should be formally arrested , released or have their cases sent back to the police , their lawyers said . the vague charge of ` provoking trouble ' has been increasingly used by chinese police under president xi jinping to detain and jail protesters from holding small-scale demonstrations . the activists were described as ` young , kind-hearted , and full of a sense of responsibility to society , ' ten of their parents and spouses wrote in a letter to beijing prosecutors which was posted online on saturday . ` these five girls , who we care for and love deeply , have not made a mistake , let alone committed a crime , ' they said , adding ` they have all striven to uphold our nation 's basic policy of gender equality ' . activist li tingting , 25 , -lrb- pictured -rrb- poses with letters protesting about the poor provision of female toilets - she and others have since been arrested . ` supporting gender equality and the interests of women is no crime ! ' their detention on march 8 has prompted renewed condemnation of china 's tight controls on political activists from human rights groups as well as the us . police interrogations of the women - several of whom suffer from chronic health problems such as asthma and an unspecified heart condition - have focused on a 2012 stunt named ` occupy men 's rooms ' , one of their lawyers , liang xiaojun , told afp on sunday . prosecutors have until monday to formally approve their arrest or police will be obliged to release the women , he added . the parents said in their letter that the women ` have been detained for over a month and we have not had a decent explanation ' . ` please restore their freedom and dignity as soon as possible ! ' they added . meanwhile china has lodged a formal protest with washington after u.s. vice president joe biden and secretary of state john kerry called for the release of the activists , the foreign ministry said on monday . the tussle over the activists could further strain ties between china and the united states , which frequently grapple over everything the value of the yuan currency to china 's growing military assertiveness . biden tweeted on saturday that china should release them , saying , ` we urge chinese leaders to show respect for women 's rights , ' and adding , ` rights of women and girls should never be suppressed . ' activtsts wei tingting , 26 , -lrb- left -rrb- wang man , 32 , -lrb- right -rrb- face charges of ` picking quarrels and provoking trouble ' in a statement on friday , kerry said the u.s. government backed the efforts of the activists , saying , ` we believe that chinese authorities should also support them , not silence them . ' china has lodged ` representations ' with the united states over the comments , foreign ministry spokesman hong lei said . ` we urge the united states to respect china 's judicial sovereignty and not use any pretext to interfere in china 's internal affairs , ' he told a daily news briefing . ` china is a country of rule of law , ' hong added . ` china 's legal authorities will handle this case in accordance with the law . ' hillary clinton , the democrats ' 2016 presidential front-runner , annoyed beijing last week with similar calls to free the women . britain and the european union have also expressed concern about the case . president xi jinping 's administration has detained hundreds of activists in the past two years , in what some rights groups say is the worst suppression of human rights in two decades . activists say the women 's cases have become a measure of beijing 's resolve in crushing all forms of civil society . zheng churan , 25 , -lrb- left -rrb- and wu rongrong , 30 -lrb- right -rrb- face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged .

pretty spot : queen victoria spent her holidays in osborne house on the isle of wight . ` it is impossible to imagine a prettier spot , ' queen victoria said of her holiday residence , osborne house on the isle of wight . it was at the beach there that she would take to the sea in her wooden bathing machine , and that all of her children learned to swim . but , however pleasing her days at osborne house , victoria 's journeys there were never easy . she would travel to portsmouth by train and then by ferry to ryde . from ryde there was a railway line that passed not far from osborne house but the nearest station was at wootton , more than two miles from the property . so , in 1875 , a station was built at whippingham , the closest point on the line to osborne house -- just to serve the royal residence . accommodation was built for the stationmaster , as well as waiting rooms with toilets for both ladies and gentlemen . the building is now a five-bedroom family home , currently on the market for # 625,000 , while the track has become a cycle path . victoria died in 1901 and the station went into public use in 1903 . however , services ended in 1966 , after which the station was converted into a home . the current owners , retired electrician tony vickers , 69 , and his 70-year-old wife sue , a retired hairdresser , are selling because they want to move to a smaller bungalow . ` we were very excited when we knew we would be able to own the station that was built for queen victoria , and we have maintained many of the original features and some of the fireplaces , ' says sue . royal connection : the home that was once a railway station built to serve the monarch . ` we are very sad to leave our unique home and its gardens , which have given us many years of pleasure . it 's been a lovely family home . ' it is thought that queen victoria , who , famously , would not allow herself to be conveyed at more than 40 miles per hour , would wait at whippingham station in the room that is now used as a sitting room . victoria , and those who visited her on the isle of wight , would be taken by horse and carriage from whippingham station to osborne house . in 1900 , whippingham station made another piece of history , with the appointment of a stationmistress , rather than master -- almost unheard of at the time . emily merwood took over the role from her father-in-law . immensely proud of being in sole charge of the station , she would dress in a white starched apron over a black dress , and would sport a straw boater hat . spacious : the large , open-plan kitchen in the isle of wight property , which has five bedrooms . the part of the house now used as a sitting room used to be the station 's waiting room , while the main bedroom used to be the points room , where the signalman would pull levers to control trains on the track . where the main platform once stood there is now a lawn that leads down to an italian garden , with raised beds , a rockery , an orchard and a small woodland beyond . price # 625,000 . location whippingham , isle of wight . bedrooms 5 . unique features former train station built for queen victoria to reach osborne house ; sitting room that victoria used as a waiting room ; main bedroom that used to be a points room . there are also two plum trees -lrb- naturally , they are victoria plums , the type named after the monarch -rrb- and a quince tree . to the left of the driveway is a common meadow with wild orchids . the property is also very versatile : alongside its five bedrooms , it has four reception rooms , a conservatory , a kitchen/dining room , a utility room , three shower rooms , a family bathroom and a downstairs cloakroom . ` this is a wonderful home which holds a great deal of character and warmth , as well as its own slice of history , ' says james shelley , sales manager at fine & country isle of wight . ` it could meet a number of needs : it could be a home to serve the requirements of two or even three generations of the same family ; a holiday home ; or a combination of the two . ` one thing is for certain here -- the choices are plenty within this amazing property , and it certainly delivers substantial levels of charm and appeal .

an amazing map revealed by nasa has shown where lightning occurs most on earth . the map reveals average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometre from 1995 to 2013 . and the results show that the highest amounts of lightning flashes occur in the far eastern democratic republic of congo and lake maracaibo in northwestern venezuela . scroll down for video . the map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013 . areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple ; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer -lrb- 0.4 square miles -rrb- - are bright pink . the democratic republic of congo was found to have the most over the period . the map was created using data from nasa 's tropical rainfall measuring mission satellite , and the orbview-1 / microlab satellite . in the map , the areas with the largest number of flashes - up to 150 per year per square kilometre -lrb- 0.4 square miles -rrb- - are shown in bright pink . the areas with the least are grey and purple . according to the satellite observations , lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans . and it also seems to happen more often closer to the equator . the higher frequency over land is because solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water , so there is greater atmospheric instability - leading to the formation of storms . and nasa 's dr daniel cecil , a member of the global hydrology and climate centre 's lightning team , said the data also shows interesting trends . according to the satellite observations , lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans . shown here is a passing storm over the african countryside with forked lightning on 10 october 2013 . the higher frequency over land is because solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water , so there is greater atmospheric instability - leading to the formation of storms . shown is a storm hitting the city of tripoli in libya . researchers have found that regardless of where you are in the world , lightning bolts are at their most powerful at 8am . this is because there are fewer particles in the atmosphere overnight , so it takes a more powerful charge to overcome the extra distance between these particles and release the bolt of power . for example , a large number of flashes were seen during the month of may in the brahmaputra valley of far eastern india . the heating and weather patterns are unstable and changeable at that time-just before the onset of the monsoon , which brings plenty of rain but much less lightning . in contrast , locations in central africa and northwestern south america have large amounts of lightning throughout the entire year . dr cecil noted that more years of data has not necessarily brought notable big-picture differences when compared to earlier maps . ` the longer record allows us to more confidently identify some of these finer details , ' he said . ` we can examine seasonality , and variability through the day and year-to-year . ' this comparable nasa map shows global lightning strikes from january 1998 to 2013 from the nasa/msfc lightning imaging sensor .

deputy pm nick clegg said control of the department for education would be a key demand of any new power-sharing deal . the liberal democrats could seize control of the nation 's schools in a coalition deal to erase michael gove 's ` zany ' ideas from the classroom , nick clegg signalled today . the deputy pm said control of the department for education would be a key demand of any new power-sharing deal . mr clegg said he wanted to avoid a repeat of battling against the ` ideological gimmicks ' of mr gove , who was the first tory education secretary when the coalition was formed in 2010 . mr clegg repeatedly clashed with mr gove over his education reforms , including tory plans to scrap gcses and a lib dem scheme to provide free school meals to under-7s . mr gove was demoted from running the ministry in last year 's cabinet reshuffle to become tory chief whip . the lib dems have sought to claim the mantle as the ` party of education ' , pledging to protect spending from ` cradle to college ' for 2 to 19-year-olds . in the 2010-15 coalition , the lib dems ran three departments : business , energy and climate change and the scotland office . as deputy pm mr clegg oversaw policies across whitehall , while danny alexander also sat in cabinet as chief secretary to the treasury , acting as george osborne 's deputy . however , senior lib dems believe the party should have demanded one of the key departments running public services , like health or education . today mr clegg signalled that he has his sights set on the department for education , which runs schools in england . asked if it was the kind of cabinet post he wanted , he said : ' i would , particularly having wasted a lot of time dealing with a lot of zany , ideological gimmicks from michael gove and his team . ` it would be a good thing if the liberal democrats were able to run education policy on our own terms , not least because we are the only party which is prepared to give the schools , colleges and nurseries the means that they need to absorb 400,000 new youngsters in our education system over the next five years . ' campaigning in cornwall , he announced plans for an independent education standards watchdog to restrict ministers ' ability to interfere with the contents of the national curriculum and exams . mr clegg said he wanted to ` get politics out of the classroom ' . establishing an educational standards authority -lrb- esa -rrb- is part of a plan for england which would also include a new royal college of teachers . other measures include curbing some of the reforms put in place by mr gove , with the lib dems insisting that all teachers in state-funded schools - including academies and free schools - have qualified status or are working towards it . a slimmed-down core national curriculum would be compulsory in all state schools , bringing free schools and academies in line with those run by councils . michael gove was demoted from running the department for education in last year 's cabinet reshuffle to become tory chief whip . the lib dems have also committed to increase funding for the education budget for two to 19-year-olds by 2020 , ensuring that the amount of cash per pupil would be protected in real terms . mr clegg said he would ` turn a page on the gove-esque centralising interference in what teachers teach in the classroom ' . he said : ` we are setting out ideas and amplifying ideas today which will take out a lot of the political interference which has dogged the day-to-day life of teachers far too much - from the micromanagement of the history curriculum by michael gove through to excessive day-to-day workload . ' mr clegg also promised to restore morale in the teaching profession . ' i get very distressed when i hear how teachers feel that they have been somewhat put upon in recent years , ' he said , promising to ` celebrate not denigrate the great , noble profession ' . the tories tonight hit back at the criticism . a friend of mr gove said : ` by zany and ideological , does clegg mean teaching children to spell properly and do their times tables ? ` or making exams harder ? or training teachers in schools rather than left-wing colleges dominated by the unions ? either he 's lost the plot or he 's lying again , as he did on tuition fees . ' a conservative party spokesman added : ` decisions about what is in the curriculum should lie in the hands of those who can be held to account by parents at the ballot box - not unelected bureaucrats as proposed by the lib dems . ` the lib dems ca n't run on their record and run away from it at the same time . they signed up to the new national curriculum , now they want to re-write it all over again . they voted for extending academy freedoms over the curriculum , now they want to scrap them . ` it 's thanks to conservative reforms that 1,000,000 more pupils are now in good or outstanding schools . conservative policies have delivered a 71 % increase in students taking rigorous academic subjects and ensured 100,000 six year olds are reading more confidently . ` the biggest risk to our education system would be the chaos of ed miliband as prime minister - and voting lib dem will only make that more likely . '

a nine-year-old girl who plummeted 30ft headfirst down the inside of a hollow tree claims she ` went to heaven and sat in jesus 's lap ' while unconscious after the fall . her mother , christy wilson beam , 42 , has spoken of her amazement after annabel , now 12 , escaped the horrifying accident unscathed - even waking miraculously cured of a devastating illness that had plagued her childhood . for the first time in her life , she can eat solid food -- and her mother thinks her brush with jesus is the reason why . scroll down for video . annabel beam , now 12 , believes she visited heaven when unconscious after falling 30ft at the age of nine . annabel -lrb- centre -rrb- , with her mother christy and father kevin and her sisters abigail -lrb- right -rrb- and adelynn -lrb- left -rrb- . in december , 2011 , annabel was playing outside the family 's texas home with her sisters abigail , now 14 and adelynn , now ten , when she slipped and fell inside a hollowed-out cottonwood tree . mum christy said : ` she hit her head three times on the way down and this is consistent with the findings of an mri scan . ` with the facts in front of me now , i see it all with sickening clarity . ` sometimes at night , it replays in my head -- a dark twist on alice tumbling down the rabbit hole . ' an emergency fire crew managed to harness annabel to safety and she was rushed to cook children 's hospital in fort worth in a helicopter . fearing the worst , medics prepped brain and spinal injury teams to stand by for annabel 's arrival -- but , incredibly , she survived without a scratch . video : today . annabel survived the horrific fall with only bumps and bruises . the doctors said ' i guess someone up there was looking out for her ' annabel 's mother , christy , and father , kevin , believe their daughter , saying she ` has no interest in melodrama ' doctors told her relieved parents : ' i guess someone up there was looking out for her . ' ` the er doc told us the one thing we were n't expecting to hear , ' her mother said . ` he said , `` other than a possibly concussion and some superficial bumps and bruises , she does n't appear to have been injured at all . '' ' -lsb- my husband -rsb- kevin and i exchanged a look of pure astonishment . ' in the days following the accident , annabel began to talk of religious visions she experienced while lying unconscious . she told her parents : ' i went to heaven when i was in that tree . i sat in jesus ' lap . ' ' i saw in anna 's eyes the conscious decision to confide in us , ' christy said . ` there was no drama , she was n't playing either . ` this was n't like one of her long , spun-out recaps of a funny dream or movie she 'd seen . ` she 'd been through enough real drama in her short life . she had no interest in melodrama . ' -lsb- she described -rsb- some of what she 'd experienced while inside the tree -- how the gates of heaven are made of gold , how jesus told her it was n't time . ' a cross marks the hollowed-out cottonwood tree , where annabel plummeted 30ft headfirst to the bottom . initially , christy was concerned that annabel was indicating a head injury , but mri and ct scans revealed she had not sustained one . further tests also revealed annabel had remarkably stopped displaying symptoms of pseudo-obstruction motility disorder , a rare incurable condition that had seen her in and out of hospital since 2008 . doctors advised she could begin to come off the antibiotics she had been taking for years . instead of taking ten different types of medication throughout the day , she only needed three , and the painkillers that were prescribed ` as and when she needed them ' were not required at all . previously , annabel 's medication meant she had to have a liquid diet or stick to soft , bland food -- but now , she can happily tuck into pizzas and mcdonald 's happy meals . the family have gone more than a year without a single visit to the doctor . ' i ca n't explain what happened to her physically while she was in that tree , ' said her father kevin . ` all i have to go on is the radiological data and the medical records from before and after . ` the proof is in the pudding . she was n't well before and now she is . ` all i know beyond that is that she believes she went to heaven . and i believe her when she tells me she believes it . ' nine-year-old annabel was playing outside with her sisters abigail and adelynn when she fell inside the tree . annabel said she saw a fairy-like guardian angel as she gained consciousness , and it stayed with her while she was rescued , shining a light so she could see . annabel talked of seeing a ` guardian angel ' as she came to . the schoolgirl said : ' i started to wake up in the tree and i could hear the firemen 's voices . and i saw an angel that looked very small , like a fairy . ` and the god winked at me through the body of the angel and what he was saying to me was , ` i 'm going to leave you now and everything is going to be okay . ` and then the angel stayed with me the entire time , shining a light so i could see . we did n't talk . we just sat together peacefully . ' she also spoke of seeing mimi , her great-grandmother who 'd died in 2010 after surgery on a blocked intestine . when asked what jesus looked like , annabel said : ` he had a beautiful long white robe , dark skin and a big beard -- kinda like santa claus , but not really . '

tons of rotting fish have filled a lagoon in rio de janeiro , brazil where olympic rowing and canoeing events will be held during next year 's games . over the past week , thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of rodrigo de freitas lake , but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause . more than 37 tons of fish have been collected , according to rio 's waste management company , but there is still an overwhelming stench , sparking complaints from neighbours and passers-by . clearing : rio 's waste management company said it has cleared more than 37 tons of fish , which have been taken to the city 's main dump . olympics : rodrigo de freitas lake is set to host the olympic rowing and canoeing events during next year 's games in rio de janeiro , brazil . there is an overwhelming stench coming from the lake and authorities and biologists have argued about about the cause of the deaths . rubbish collectors will continue to rake the decomposing fish , a small silvery species called twaite shad , off the water 's surface until the the mass dying subsides . they are being taken to the city 's main dump . the die-offs are common in rio , where rivers , lakes and even the ocean are blighted by raw sewage and garbage . rower and olympic hopeful felipe xavier said : ' i have to come train but these dead fish bother us because the smell is very strong and the huge amount of fish slows the boat . ' but alexandre fernandez , rowing coach of botafogo club based in rio , said he had no worries about the phenomenon and believes the cause was natural , not because of pollution . in february , twaite shad died in the blighted waters of guanabara bay , where the olympic sailing events are to be held . members of a local rowing club have to train among the dead fish in rodrigo de freitas lake ahead of the olympic games in the city in 2016 . rubbish collectors will continue to clear the decomposing fish , a small silvery species called twaite shad , off the water 's surface in rio . more than 37 tons of fish have been collected , according to rio 's waste management company , but there is still an overwhelming stench . the dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to rio de janeiro 's main dump . rio 's environmental secretariat has insisted that the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature . ` the intense rains that happened last week and a rise in the sea levels led to a spike in the -lrb- sea -rrb- water entering the lake , causing a thermal shock , ' it said in a statement , reporting that water temperature in the lake quickly fell by 4c . however , several scientists have rejected that explanation , saying that pollution is really to blame . estefan monteiro da fonseca , an oceanographer at fluminense federal university , said the official explanation ` makes no sense ' . despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water , there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . picturesque ? rio de janeiro 's stunning landscape has been blighted by the dead fish , which are currently being cleared from the water . lagoon : there are so many fish on the surface of the lake in rio de janeiro , brazil that almost no water can be seen in some places . alexandre fernandez -lrb- not pictured -rrb- , rowing coach of botafogo club , said he 's not worried and believes the cause of the deaths was natural . he said : ` the lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage . ' he added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it , and depending on the wind , that material rises to the surface and kills fish . rio 's water quality has become one of the most contentious issues heading into the 2016 olympics . authorities have long said the games would be the catalyst for a major cleanup of the city 's waterways , but as the sporting event approaches with few improvements , they are now admitting that the olympic promises wo n't be met . natural causes ? rio 's environmental secretariat has insisted that the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature . passers-by have to hold their noses because of the overwhelming stench coming from the surface of the water , where rowers are training . rubbish collection : a man sits on a boat filled with dead fish in rodrigo de freitas lake , where olympic events are due to be held next year . training : a man rows in the lake surrounded by thousands of dead fish ahead of the olympics in the south american city next year . rio governor luiz fernando pezao acknowledged earlier this week ` there 's not going to be time ' to finish the cleanup ahead of the games , suggesting it might take until the end of 2018 instead . sailors have repeatedly voiced concerns about possible health and safety threats posed by competing in rio 's waters . mr fonseca warned that if another fish die-off occurs during the games in august 2016 , ` rio 's image could suffer irreparable damage ' . rio governor luiz fernando pezao acknowledged earlier this week ` there 's not going to be time ' to finish the cleanup ahead of the games . an oceanographer said that if another fish die-off occurs during the games in august 2016 , ` rio 's image could suffer irreparable damage ' . authorities have said the games would be the catalyst for a major cleanup of the city 's waterways , but there have been few improvements .

tony abbott may have thrilled players at an australian rules function by skolling a beer but he 's drawn the ire of anti-drinking campaigners who claim he 's glorifying binge drinking and associating being a man with drinking booze . julie robert , a cultural studies professor at the university of technology sydney , said it was ` problematic ' that the prime minister , who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking , thought it acceptable to ` showcase his masculinity ' by skolling a beer . ` it sets up a culture that drinking is n't about socialising with friends , it 's about how quickly and how much you can drink , ' she said . scroll down for video . australian prime minister tony abbott was cheered on by a crowd of about 50 as he skolled a schooner of beer . mr abbott came under fire after the incident as anti-drinking campaigners said he was glorifying binge drinking . ` it sets up a culture that drinking is n't about socialising with friends , it 's about how quickly and how much you can drink . ' on saturday night mr abbott appeared happy to oblige when he was asked to have a drink by university of technology sydney bats coach simon carradous . it took the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted ` skol ' and ` tony ' . dr robert warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much , or how quickly , they can drink . ` it is the whole performance and the display and showing off which is the problematic part , ' she told daily mail australia . however , she said it was not just mr abbott 's skol that was concerning , it was also the way media and other government officials have reacted to the event . in an interview on sunday , opposition leader bill shorten quipped that he was ` just pleased that tony abbott 's learning to drink beer without adding lemonade to it ' . mr abbott was labelled ` un-australian ' for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign . dr robert said while drinking was a part of the australian tradition , it was dangerous to make comments that would only glorify irresponsible drinking practices and perpetuate the stereotype that drinking heavily makes you a true blue aussie bloke . critics said he should be setting an example that you do n't have to drink heavily to be a ` true blue aussie bloke ' it appeared to take the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner , as players cheered and chanted ` skol ' and ` tony ' health minister sussan ley was quick to jump to mr abbott 's defence saying there was ` nothing wrong ' with the prime minister 's antics . `` if more people got up at 4.30 in the morning and went running and cycling and worked as hard as our prime minister to keep fit and demonstrate that there are many ways that you can do this , i think we 'd have a healthier country as a result , '' ms ley said . during his night out , mr abbott gave a speech to the players , according to australian women 's weekly . ` he grabs the microphone and gives a speech , which went along the lines of : ` well is n't this a real treat , i 've been a rugby man all my life but now i finally get to hang out with some real footballers ' to which of course the crowd went crazy , ' coach carradous said . ` then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner , dribbling little bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch . ' while mr abbott is not the first australian prime minister to show off his skolling skills , with former labor prime minister bob hawke a notable example , dr roberts said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking . ' i do n't necessarily think it 's a partisan thing but i do think the climate has changed and we did n't -lsb- used to -rsb- have the concern over binge drinking that we do now , ' she said . mr abbott was asked to have a drink by university of technology sydney bats coach simon carradous , and the prime minister happily obliged . ` he drank the entire schooner , dribbling bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch , ' a witness said .

a federal judge has approved a plan to resolve concussion lawsuits brought by more than 5,000 former players that could cost the league $ 1billion over 65 years . the deal comes after the league has been dogged for years by complaints that it long hid the risks of repeated concussions in order to return players to the field . the nfl expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from alzheimer 's disease or moderate dementia someday . the settlement approved on wednesday by a federal judge in philadelphia would pay them about $ 190,000 on average . senior us district judge anita brody -lrb- left -rrb- approved the deal on wednesday after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out . former philadelphia eagles fullback kevin turner -lrb- right -rrb- suffers from lou gehrig 's disease and led the lawsuit against the nfl . the settlement also includes allowing for monetary awards of up to $ 5million per claimant for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma . senior u.s. district judge anita brody approved the deal after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out . the negotiators did not increase the original $ 765million plan , but agreed to remove that number as the cap . the deal means the nfl may never have to disclose what it knew when about the risks and treatment of concussions . players ' lawyers have argued that the settlement will help families get needed financial awards or medical testing that might take years if the case went to trial . the league expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from alzheimer 's disease or moderate dementia someday . nfl commissioner roger goodell -lrb- above -rrb- has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent players from getting concussions . the league 's top lawyer said brody 's approval ` powerfully underscores the fairness and propriety ' of the settlement . ` retirees and their families will be eligible for prompt and substantial benefits and will avoid years of costly litigation that -- as judge brody 's comprehensive opinion makes clear -- would have an uncertain prospect of success , ' nfl general counsel jeff pash said in a statement . the total nfl payouts over 65 years , including interest and $ 112million sought for lawyer fees , is expected to be more than $ 1billion . critics contend the nfl is getting off lightly given annual revenues of about $ 10billion . however , plaintiffs would have first had to fight their way into court -- instead of getting booted to nfl mediation under their players ' contracts -- to prevail . about 200 nfl retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually including the family of former new england patriots linebacker junior seau -lrb- above -rrb- . seau -lrb- above -rrb- committed suicide at his san diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior . an autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy or cte . ` from a business point of view , -lrb- the nfl has -rrb- ... avoided what may have been the biggest risk to their continued prosperity , ' said andrew brandt , director of the sports law program at villanova university law school . ` removing this as a threat is extraordinary , ' he said . the nfl lawsuits , and similar suits filed later against the nhl , the ncaa and others , has fostered debate , discussion and safety reforms about sports concussions . yet the nfl games seem to be as wildly popular as ever . ' i know people talk about , it 's dangerous , and mothers wo n't let their sons play football . but i do n't see that . i do n't see that at all , ' brandt said . about 200 nfl retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually . they include the family of junior seau , the popular pro bowler who killed himself at his san diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior . an autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte . the nfl earlier this year said concussions have dropped by 36 per cent after they changed the way players tackle -lrb- above david bruton # 30 of the denver broncos lies on the ground in pain in 2014 -rrb- . brody most recently asked for several tweaks , including partial credit for time played in nfl europe and other developmental leagues , to broaden the settlement . negotiators quickly agreed to her suggestions . she rejected other complaints raised at a november hearing , including those who say the agreement does not cover future deaths from chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed after death , or contemplate the day when it might be diagnosed in the living . others oppose the award reductions for older men and those who played fewer than five years in the league . ` although objectors insist that there must be compensation for cte , the nfl parties were unwilling to settle claims based solely on a -lrb- diagnosis -rrb- ... rather than on manifest neurocognitive deficits , ' the lead negotiators wrote in a march court filing urging brody to approve the deal . ` many of the behavioral and mood conditions claimed to be associated with cte are prevalent within the general public .

from the moment i set foot on my terrace overlooking the scenic douro river to the divine meal i ate at its michelin-starred restaurant , the yeatman played a wonderful trick on me . the five-star hotel in porto celebrates all things wine - port wine , in particular - and has the feel of a place steeped in decades-old tradition , with a prime location , classic design and unblemished attention to detail . but , to my surprise , the yeatman has been open for just five years - a fraction of the age of some of the pricier bottles in its wine cellar . in those five years it has been hitting all the right notes , developing a reputation as a haven for wine lovers and one of portugal 's best luxury hotels . the bacchus suite at the yeatman boasts a high-vaulted wooden ceiling , copper jacuzzi , fireplace and a rotating bed . portugal 's first wine hotel is built into a hill , providing sweeping views of porto and the douro river from the indoor pool and guest rooms . when guests arrive at the yeatman they set foot in a stunning lobby with a statue of bacchus , the roman god of wine . for guests like myself , who know little about wine but will never allow it to go to waste , it presents an opportunity to learn and develop an appreciation for the picturesque douro region 's nectar . even though the hotel is dedicated to wine , it 's not just for enthusiasts . regardless of their knowledge or palate , guests can take advantage of two other things that the yeatman specialises in : relaxation and imaginative food . when i arrived on a friday night i stepped into the immaculate lobby - accentuated with a statue of bacchus , the roman god of wine - to the sound of an acoustic guitar drifting from dick 's bar , the in-house bar where couples canoodle on couches and bartenders mix port wine cocktails . with more than 80 wines by the glass it is the only bar in porto to remain open 24 hours a day . public spaces inside the five-star hotel , including the lobby and dick 's bar , offer a breathtaking view of portugal 's second-largest city . the yeatman is located in vila nova de gaia ; it is separated from porto by the douro river , which spills into the atlantic ocean . the yeatman 's large decanter-shaped infinity pool is heated and surrounded by a terrace with plenty of space to lounge in the sun . from the statue of bacchus , guests ' attention usually moves to the large glass doors and windows that offer sweeping views of the river and the luis i bridge , which links porto and vila nova de gaia . guests are afforded the same luxury when they enter their room and set foot on the private terrace , which has impressive views across the river of portugal 's second-largest city . the yeatman , portugal 's first luxury wine hotel , is built into a hill in vila nova de gaia , with all of its 82 rooms facing the river and almost every one themed after a portuguese winery . guest rooms at the yeatman face the river , and almost all of them are themed after a portuguese winery -lrb- pictured : superior room -rrb- . each guest room is decorated in an understated , classic style , with a private terrace where guests can relax outdoors . no visit to porto in northern portugal is complete without a sampling of its most famous export - port wine . guests at the yeatman are just a short walk from taylor 's wine lodges and cellars , where its port wine ages in thousands of barrels . owned by taylor , fladgate & yeatman , which owns the hotel , the compound offers informative tours and tastings , with visitors learning about the history of the sweet wine and the house of taylor 's , which is in its fourth century . after the tour guests are offered three port wines - chip dry -lrb- extra dry white -rrb- , late bottled vintage and 10-year-old tawny - and they can pay extra to sample premium port wines . my tour included a stop inside one of the cellars , which houses nearly 2,000 barrels containing port wine as old as 1880 and a giant barrel capable of holding 100,000 litres . located next door to the yeatman , taylor 's port wine cellars offers affordable informational tours and tastings for visitors . my superior room , themed after the quinta do passadouro winery , was decorated with its labelled bottles , photos of its vineyard and regional artefacts , plus vintage-like furniture and lime green curtains , giving it a luxurious but laid-back feel . like the rooms , each floor has a theme . floor one , where the outdoor pool is located , is decorated with framed maps of portugal , while other floors focus on local history or portuguese discoveries . wine is front and centre at this polished hotel , owned by centuries-old port wine producer taylor , fladgate & yeatman , but one could argue that the real star of the show is the gastronomic restaurant . the restaurant at the yeatman is the only one in porto to carry a michelin star , offering exceptional service and creative dishes . tasting menus include dishes such as crispy suckling pig belly -lrb- pictured -rrb- , and codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree . it is the only restaurant in porto to carry a michelin star , and during my visit i was treated to a two-hour culinary masterclass with exceptional service and creative dishes from start to finish . the tasting menu included a langoustine broth with crunchy langoustine and champagne sauce , roasted codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree , crispy suckling pig belly with cardinal prawn slices and herb sprouts , and a chocolate cafe with toffee and caramel ice cream - all paired with portuguese wines . best enjoyed before indulging , guests can spoil themselves at the caudalie vinotherapie spa , which offers a number of treatments that stick with the hotel 's wine theme . guests can spoil themselves at the caudalie vinotherapie spa , which offers a number of treatments that stick with the wine theme . spa visits include access to a roman bath -lrb- pictured -rrb- , sauna and the yeatman 's indoor panoramic infinity pool . spectacular views are enjoyed from the spa 's private barrel bath rooms , where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a grape extract . i was treated to the spa 's signature massage - the caudalie relaxing massage , with grape extract oils - after spending some time in the relaxation room , which offers another impressive vantage point of the hustle and bustle across the river . tap portugal -lrb- www.flytap.com , 0345 601 0932 -rrb- flies from london gatwick to porto 14 times a week , with return fares starting at # 120 including all taxes and surcharges . porto airport is just a 20-minute drive from the yeatman . spectacular views can also be enjoyed from the spa 's private barrel bath rooms , where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a conditioning grape extract . the spa has two levels connected by a spiral staircase set within a giant port wine barrel , and guests also have access to a roman bath , sauna and the yeatman 's indoor panoramic infinity pool . from the spa to the restaurant and everywhere in between , everything at the yeatman comes back to wine , with the hotel acting as an ambassador . one of the features that should delight anyone with an appreciation for it is a ` working cellar ' on the lower level . open two hours every day , guests can head down with a sommelier to pick out a wine - from portugal or another wine-producing nation - to pair with their dinner . after my two-night stay at the yeatman i still consider myself a novice when it comes to the finer points of wine , but i left feeling confident that there will be fewer surprises the next time i pick up a bottle at the supermarket . the yeatman . rua do choupelo -lrb- santa marinha -rrb- . vila nova de gaia . porto 4400-088 . portugal . +351 220 133 100 . www.the-yeatman-hotel.com . rooms starting from $ 175 in low season and $ 250 in high season . the yeatman is offering a summer programme from may 1 to october 31 , requiring a minimum two nights ' stay in a superior room or suite . on a per-night basis prices start from $ 310 for double occupancy in a superior room or $ 495 in a suite , with guests receiving 20 per cent off the price of treatments at the caudalie vinotherapie spa , a luxurious buffet breakfast served in the orangerie room , car parking , and late check-out . children stay for free , and the programme includes access to the well-being area , indoor and outdoor pools , and gymnasium . visit taylor 's website for information on port wine cellar tours and tastings .

imagine a future where humans are skiing on the surface of a distant moon and living in floating cities on venus - while earth lies in ruin . that 's the future envisioned by an artist in a fantastic series of ` tourism ' posters , showcasing his dream for how we might one day explore the stars . and he hopes the posters encourage us to expand our presence into the solar system - especially as our planet is vulnerable to cosmic disasters . scroll down for video . artist frank mckeever from florida created these amazing posters . they show how we could colonise various worlds in the solar system . included are humans skiing on a moon of uranus and living in cities on mars . others show life on europa and near saturn - and a destroyed earth -lrb- shown -rrb- . the posters were created by artist and entrepreneur frank mckeever , 28 , from st augustine in florida and his colleague miranda . mr mckeever runs an art business called science hype with his wife nicole , where each of these posters can be bought . all the posters seen here are hand-drawn , and then taken into photoshop and illustrator to finish them off . mr mckeever told mailonline his inspiration for the posters came from his love of travel , retro-style designs and a love of space . ` to us , it 's reminiscent of ads that were displayed during the 60s , and seeing as that was the time of the space race , it just made sense to present space posters in that medium , ' he said . perhaps the most striking image is the one of earth seemingly destroyed and uninhabitable . it 's a future that has left many experts to recently call for more effort to be made to protect earth from threats such as asteroids - and expand our presence into the solar system . ` the destroyed earth was big for me , ' said mr mckeever . ` i began thinking about the possibility of being hit by an asteroid - especially with the fact that a huge one just flew awfully close to us a few days ago . ' another poster shows humans living on the surface of mars in cities , which frank says he thinks is ` very possible ' . he added : ` i can see that happening in my lifetime . and i think it should . ' on mercury - the closest planet to the sun - is a large crater 960 miles -lrb- 1,550 km -rrb- wide called the caloris basin , which mr mckeever thinks we might explore -lrb- left -rrb- . colonisation of mars in the form of a city , meanwhile , is something that may also be a possibility -lrb- right -rrb- . venus is known to have an earth-like band in its atmosphere about 30 miles -lrb- 50km -rrb- above the surface , where some have said it could be possible to place floating space colonies -lrb- shown -rrb- . neptune has 14 known moons , the largest of which is triton , which mr mckeever thinks we might colonise -lrb- left -rrb- . maybe one day we will also return to the moon -lrb- right -rrb- , with a destroyed earth in the background - while one of the apollo flags has been bleached white from radiation . owing to the orbits of earth and mars , there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place . our planets come as close as 33.9 million miles -lrb- 54.6 million km -rrb- , but can be as distant as 250 million miles -lrb- 400 million km -rrb- . for this reason spacecraft to mars , such as the curiosity rover , have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned . the next window is open from january 2016 to april 2016 , and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet . for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in another . just getting there will take up to nine months . the astronauts will then be there waiting for a year until they can come back , again taking up to nine months - a total of around three years . many have wondered whether it might be possible to colonise certain corners of the solar system before . venus , for example , is known to have an earth-like band in its atmosphere about 30 miles -lrb- 50km -rrb- above the surface , where some have said it could be possible to place floating space colonies . in fact , in 1985 the soviet union sent two balloons into the atmosphere of venus - vega 1 and 2 - to provide key evidence for this potentially habitable band . europa , meanwhile , has often been said to be a potential place to find life in the solar system - and mr mckeever has imagined we might live there one day , too . nasa is in the process of designing its unmanned europa clipper spacecraft , which would arrive at the moon of jupiter in the 2020s and fly through geysers erupting from its surface . using specialised instruments , it might be able to detect life in an underground ocean - if there is any there . the icy moon of miranda -lrb- shown -rrb- , meanwhile , is the smallest and innermost of the moons of uranus . the gas giant planet is seen in the distance here above the horizon of the moon . mr mckeever also imagines a future where we can tour the historic rings of saturn -lrb- left -rrb- , while europa - known for its ice surface with geysers of water erupting - may one day be ` your new home ' -lrb- right -rrb- . ` space exploration and essentially spreading our seed is so important , ' mr mckeever continued . ` earth does not have enough resources to last all of us forever . we 've looked up at the stars for thousands and thousands of years , always wondering what they are . ` and now , while we do not yet have the ability to traverse the galaxy , we do have the ability to land on other terrestrial bodies such as the moon . ` and technology is getting to where we will be able to land a human on mars in just ten or twenty years . ` that to me is absolutely remarkable . if you would have told this to someone 100 years ago , they would have thought you were out of your mind .

imran uddin used a keyboard spying device to hack into university computers and up his exam marks . a student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed . imran uddin , 25 , who was studying science , bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers . through the software , which recorded key strokes , he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers . he then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself . after hacking into the university computer system , uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments . on one paper , he upped his mark from 57 per cent , a lower second grade , to 73 per cent , a first . he carried out his plot using keyboard ` shadowing ' devices which look like a usb stick and can be bought for as little as # 49 on the internet . he plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the university of birmingham where he was studying . the device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data . uddin , from birmingham , was in his final year of a bio-science course . at the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree . he was jailed for four months at birmingham crown court on thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the computer misuse act . sentencing him , judge james burbridge said it was unclear why uddin had tried to change his grades . judge burbridge said : ` for reasons not entirely clear to me , whether it was monetary , or pride , or a desire to outperform others , you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that . i consider your actions were planned and persistent . ' he warned that uddin 's behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system . the judge added that he felt compelled to put uddin behind bars as a ` deterrence ' to others . judge burbridge said : ` this kind of conduct undermines , or has the potential to undermine , public confidence in the degree system , set up by this university . i have decided i can not pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence . ' uddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on october 7 last year . when they removed the protective casing from the computers in the bio-science building , the spying devices were discovered . staff then began checking other university computer equipment and a further three spying devices were found . madhu rai , prosecuting , said : ` it is effectively a case where the defendant has hacked into a number of computers at the university where he was studying for a degree in bio-science . ' miss rai said one tracker had been attached to a computer in a ` staff only ' area to obtain the password of employee christine chapman , who had access to exam grade software . uddin -lrb- police mugshot , left , and outside court , right -rrb- , who is married , was yesterday jailed for four months after admitting six breaches to the computer misuse act . birmingham crown court -lrb- pictured -rrb- heard how uddin attached a ` shadowing ' keyboard device at the back of a number of university computers in order to steal staff passwords . an investigation by university staff revealed that uddin had changed the marks on five pieces of his coursework . his home was searched by police and analysis of his computer revealed that he had carried out searches for keyboard cheating devices on the online marketplace ebay . balbir singh , defending , said uddin had felt pressure because he was the first person in his family to have gone to university . as a result of the need he felt to succeed , ` he could not see clearly ' , mr singh said . he added : ` it is very unlikely that any other university will touch him after this . this is not a case where he was hopelessly failing and was not going to be able to succeed .

a hedgehog sniffing around in the dusk was once a common sight - but experts warn it may soon become a thing of the past . one in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their gardens , according to a wildlife survey . and of those who do spot the tiny animals , only a quarter see them frequently , the rspb found . the startling figures confirm fears that the small british mammal is suffering a huge decline . there are thought to be less than 1 million hedgehogs living in this country today , an estimated 30 per cent drop since 2013 . one in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their gardens , according to a new wildlife survey . part of the reason is the widespread loss of the traditional hedgerows that used to line every country road . but the loss of bushes and hedges in back gardens is also thought to have played a role in the animal 's demise . mark eaton , conservation scientist at the rspb , said that the popularity of hard wooden or metal fences has made it hard for hedgehogs to move from place to place . as they become isolated in smaller and smaller areas of greenery , they can not feed or mate . ` a few decades ago there were tens of millions of hedgehogs in britain , now we think there are maybe 1 million left , ' mr eaton said . ` most of the reason is down to the change in the way we manage our countryside - the loss of hedgerows and woodlands has removed their habitat and the increase in the use of pesticides has removed a lot of the beetles and other animals they feed on . ` but there are concerns about the way we garden as well . ` hedgehogs have to make their way through the maze of back gardens , trying to find gaps in fences . ` it does n't matter if you have a garden with the most juicy hedgehog food , with lots of slugs and worms - if you fence them out , they are not going to get in . ' part of the reason is the widespread loss of the traditional hedgerows that used to line every country road . cutting holes of just a few inches - about the size of a cd - is enough for a hedgehog to get through a fence , experts say . more than 420,000 people provided information about the wildlife in their back garden as part of the rspb big garden birdwatch . some 65 per cent said they had seen a hedgehog in the last year - but only 28 per cent saw them once a month or more . some 20 per cent of participants had never seen a hedgehog in their garden . people were more likely to see a non-native grey squirrel than native hedgehogs , with squirrels spotted in 74 per cent of gardens at least monthly throughout the year . red squirrels , which have been lost from large parts of the country , were seen at least monthly in just 2 per cent of gardens . conservationists are worried that once-common snakes are also vanishing . six out of ten people reported they had never seen a grass snakes and half had never seen a slow worm , another variety of snake . daniel hayhow , rspb conservation scientist , said : ` despite remaining widespread in many areas of the uk , important habitats for slow worms and grass snakes have been lost . ` as gardens become tidier , reptile homes have been lost , leaving a shortage of habitats in which to live and breed . piles of logs , compost heaps and ponds provide ideal warm , sheltered environments for these species to breed , find food and to hibernate . ' henry johnson , hedgehog officer for the people 's trust for endangered species , urged people to take steps in their garden to help hedgehogs find food and shelter . he said : ` spotting animals is just the start . for more people to see hedgehogs in the future , we need more holes in fences , joining up gardens , and more insect-friendly gardening . '
