-lrb- cnn -rrb- on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in china 's northwestern xinjiang region . but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . armed soldiers guarded the exits . in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . three were sentenced to death . the public mass sentencing was part a china 's `` strike hard '' campaign against unrest in xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism . '' but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . much of it makes for grim reading . in pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december . more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . iran and iraq executed people for `` terrorism , '' and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . in indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety `` national emergency . '' six people have already been executed this year . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . the numbers speak for themselves . in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice . last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607 . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . the americas continued to be execution-free , apart from the united states . those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the rev. robert h. schuller , california televangelist and founder of the television ministry `` hour of power , '' died thursday , according to his family . he was 88 years old . schuller , also the founder of crystal cathedral megachurch , had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in august 2013 , a release from `` hour of power '' said . `` my father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning . he was a great dad and a great man of god , '' said schuller 's daughter-in-law , donna schuller , in a twitter message . schuller 's life followed an almost shakespearean arc . he was born in a iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days . in his autobiography , `` prayer : my soul 's adventure with god , '' he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation . after attending a hope college and western theological seminary in michigan , he met his wife of more than 60 years , arvella , while preaching at her church -lrb- she was the organist -rrb- . with their young family in tow , the schullers caravanned west to california , where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar . it was beneath the dignity of christian ministry , some local pastors huffed . the `` passion pits '' where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel . schuller was undeterred , and he quickly outgrew the drive-in . he called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a `` miracle , '' though his many mainstream critics had other names for it . his confident , breezy version of christianity -- too breezy , by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-war american preachers . schuller sold a softer , gentler message , which borrowed heavily , he acknowledged , from the father of the feel-good gospel , norman vincent peale . he preached not to convert or condemn people , but to encourage them , a sentiment he called `` possibility thinking . '' people loved it . `` evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people , '' said timothy larsen , a professor of christian thought at wheaton college in illinois . `` and schuller was a master at that . '' `` what he got right is that the gospel is good news , '' larsen continued . `` and he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope . '' some of schuller 's favored phrases , though , struck others as cornpone christianity . `` turn your hurt into a halo ? '' said randall balmer , a professor of american religious history at dartmouth college , citing one such phrase . `` that 's pretty weak tea . '' still , balmer gives schuller some credit . `` it may be bad theology , but it 's brilliant marketing . '' in 1970 , schuller began broadcasting `` hour of power , '' believed to be one of the first , if not the very first , sunday service to be shown regularly on television . with his genial smile , priestly robes and gray hair , he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed . the show , which ran for decades , reached millions , making schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors . schuller 's crowning achievement , at least architecturally , still stands in orange county , california , though it is now owned by the roman catholic church . the crystal cathedral , a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels , gave worshipers a look at the clouds that house the heavens , while schuller preached in the pulpit below . the message was clear to many : the road to the former ran through the latter . during the 1980s and 1990s , schuller 's star continued to rise , with presidents stopping by the crystal cathedral -- often during campaigns , it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like rick warren and bill hybels seeking his advice . as schuller aged , though , his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of `` king lear . '' he tried to install his only son , bobby jr. , as pastor of crystal cathedral . but the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance . bobby schuller jr. left `` hour of power '' and the pulpit at crystal cathedral after a short time . as the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances , viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously . crystal cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010 , citing debts of more than $ 43 million , according to the associated press . schuller 's empire , which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral , had fallen to dust . eventually , schuller 's grandson , also named bobby , took over `` hour of power , '' though at a different church . in a statement on thursday , the younger schuller recalled standing atop crystal cathedral 's 12-story tower of hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape . `` you could see the whole world from there , '' he said . people we 've lost in 2015 . cnn 's stella chan reported from los angeles .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- never mind cats having nine lives . a stray pooch in washington state has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car , apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive . that 's according to washington state university , where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named theia -- has been receiving care at the veterinary teaching hospital . four days after her apparent death , the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm , dirt-covered and emaciated , where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help . she was taken in by moses lake , washington , resident sara mellado . `` considering everything that she 's been through , she 's incredibly gentle and loving , '' mellado said , according to wsu news . `` she 's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life . '' theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . she suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . she 's also created a facebook page to keep supporters updated . donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by theia 's tale of survival against the odds . on the fundraising page , mellado writes , `` she is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . i agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home . '' she is dedicated to making sure theia gets the medical attention she needs , mellado adds , and wants to `` make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again ! '' any additional funds raised will be `` paid forward '' to help other animals . theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks . a cat in tampa , florida , found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in january , showed up alive in a neighbor 's yard five days after he was buried by his owner . the cat was in bad shape , with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye , but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the humane society .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you 've been following the news lately , there are certain things you doubtless know about mohammad javad zarif . he is , of course , the iranian foreign minister . he has been u.s. secretary of state john kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . and he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in iran on a sunny friday morning . `` long live zarif , '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . you may well have read that he is `` polished '' and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , `` jovial . '' an internet search for `` mohammad javad zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results . he certainly has gone a long way to bring iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . but there are some facts about zarif that are less well-known . here are six : . in september 2013 , zarif tweeted `` happy rosh hashanah , '' referring to the jewish new year . that prompted christine pelosi , the daughter of house minority leader nancy pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : `` thanks . the new year would be even sweeter if you would end iran 's holocaust denial , sir . '' and , perhaps to her surprise , pelosi got a response . `` iran never denied it , '' zarif tweeted back . `` the man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . happy new year . '' the reference was likely to former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by ahmadinejad 's successor , hassan rouhami . his foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the united states . '' that is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the shah of iran , which began in 1977 , and during the iranian revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from san francisco state university in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the university of denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the university of denver in 1988 . both of his children were born in the united states . the website of the iranian foreign ministry , which zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . the first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in tehran , says zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in tehran in 1959 . '' later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as january 8 , 1960 . and the iranian diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . so he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , kerry , who is 71 . the feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the alavi foundation , a charitable organization . the u.s. justice department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the iranian government to launder money and get around u.s. sanctions . but last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in manhattan along with other properties to the u.s. government , did not mention zarif 's name . early in the iranian revolution , zarif was among the students who took over the iranian consulate in san francisco . the aim , says the website iranian.com -- which cites zarif 's memoirs , titled `` mr. ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently islamic . later , the website says , zarif went to make a similar protest at the iranian mission to the united nations . in response , the iranian ambassador to the united nations offered him a job . in fact , he has now spent more time with kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . and that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a june 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in switzerland .

los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's more than just one state 's internal problem . the historic california drought hurts the rest of the union , too . that 's because california is a breadbasket to the nation , growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts . here 's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state , a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted gov. jerry brown to announce a mandatory 25 % cutback in water consumption in all cities . in 2014 , one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the california drought . he was often right , according to statistics gathered by timothy richards , agribusiness professor at arizona state university . prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table : . • berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $ 3.88 . • broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $ 1.89 . • grapes by 64 cents a pound to $ 3.06 . • melons by 24 cents a pound to $ 1.23 . • packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $ 2.91 . • peppers by 26 cents a pound to $ 2.39 . though fruits and vegetable prices fell in february , overall prices are expected to rise this year , because of inflation , u.s. department of agriculture economist annemarie kuhns said . fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5 % and 3.5 % , and vegetables between 2 % and 3 % , close to historical average increases , kuhns said . whether the california drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown , thanks to a strong dollar . the greenback 's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of west coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation , kuhns said . moreover , the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from california to the other 49 states , she said . what economists do n't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought . those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices , she said . `` the drought in california does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter , '' kuhns said . `` we are not sure what the exact impact will be . '' the reality is there 's a major drought throughout the west and southwest . while not as bad as california , texas and oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states , the u.s. drought monitor said this week . overall , the western drought affects more than 52 million people , the monitor says . as a result , consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1 % for beef and veal in 2014 , the usda reports . straining under a drought that began in 2012 , ranchers in texas and oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures , paid more for feed , and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle . so the cattlemen began culling their herds , kuhns said . this year 's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6 % at most , still higher than the 4.1 % historical average , the feds project . but beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought . `` there 's other areas being affected , '' kuhns said . it 's called the golden state for the gold rush of yore , but let 's face it : the rest of the nation flocks to california for vacation because of another golden reason . its year-round sunshine . so the next time you take a holiday in california , you 'll find a few changes around here , thanks to the drought . like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant . you wo n't find water waiting for you on the table . eateries now `` can only serve water to customers on request , '' the state water resources control board declared in march under expanded emergency regulations . tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily . these requests are mandatory under the new regulations . and they 'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains . because much of the snowpack in the sierra nevada has alarmingly disappeared , many ski resorts shut down early this year , including at lake tahoe , and some are now building zip lines , mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming , the sacramento bee reported . `` if the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more , the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are , '' state water board chair felicia marcus said in march . but what about those yummy california wines , you ask ? guess what . they 're only getting better -- because of the drought . yes , you read that right . the 2014 wine grape harvest was `` third in a string of great vintages this decade , '' the wine institute says . `` california vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage , despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south napa in late august just as crush was getting underway , '' the institute said in a statement last year . `` a mild winter and spring caused early bud break , although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years . '' wine grapes use relatively low water , said institute spokeswoman gladys horiuchi . `` yes , drought years tend to produce terrific quality , '' she added . `` with the record high california wine grape harvests in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , there is a good supply of california wine . '' that may be the only thing to toast about this drought .

norfolk , virginia -lrb- cnn -rrb- the second mate of the houston express probably could n't believe what he was seeing . hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby . at first it looked abandoned . it was in bad shape , listing to one side . the crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked . incredibly , as they got closer , they saw there was a man on it , signaling for help . `` he was moving , walking around , waving to us and in surprisingly good condition , '' capt. thomas grenz told cnn by phone friday . that man , louis jordan , 37 , had an amazing story . he 'd been drifting on the 35-foot pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving conway , south carolina , to fish in the ocean . just a few days into his trip , a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast . one of his shoulders was broken , too , so he could n't fix the boat right away . eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail , but he could make little headway against the currents . `` it took so long , '' jordan said . `` it moved so slowly . '' the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued , according to jordan . his father , frank jordan , told cnn 's jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different . `` he looked good . had n't lost too much weight . he was n't badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be , '' he said . lost at sea for 66 days . after his food and water ran out , it became an issue of survival . collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan . the weather would n't cooperate . records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing . the precipitation came at night during harsh conditions . `` i had tried to collect -lrb- rain -rrb- water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat , '' jordan said . `` the waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad . `` finally the conditions were right . i filled up my water tank , which is 25 gallons . i filled up a bucket . '' then there was the issue of food . the fish were n't cooperating , but after a while jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry , which he would put out to sea for a rinse . the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net , he said . jordan came ashore thursday evening . cnn affiliate wavy in norfolk , virginia , reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into sentara norfolk general hospital about 7:30 p.m. coast guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt jordan 's incredible story . they noted that his father contacted them january 29 to report his son and his boat missing . frank jordan addressed the skepticism about his son 's appearance , saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time . his son spent most of his days in the cabin , out of the sun . frank jordan said it was obvious when the jordans met at the hospital friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal . `` i know he went through what he went through , '' frank jordan said . jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in conway . he had free rent and free food in the river , he said . but when it became difficult to catch dinner , he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish . frank jordan told cnn 's wolf blitzer on thursday that he had worried about his son , who is an inexperienced sailor , but he held hope because his son had a good boat . and he had the strength to make it . `` he 's got a very strong constitution and -lrb- is strong -rrb- not only physically , but spiritually , '' frank jordan said . `` and he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time , so i believe that sustained him a great deal . '' rescue swimmer kyle mccollum was the first to care for jordan on the flight back to land . `` you would expect sunburns , severe sunburn , blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him , '' he said . `` but for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing . '' grenz was also surprised by jordan 's condition , physically and mentally . the rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was , remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days . jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry . `` we took him to a rescue boat , '' the container ship captain said . `` he was given water and pea soup to gain some power again . '' derriel morris , a neighbor at the bucksport plantation marina & rv resort called jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat , named `` angel . '' morris said : `` it was immaculate , it was gorgeous , beautifully painted . i mean it looked like a brand new sailboat . '' morris told cnn affiliate wpde that one day in january he was going to the store and jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer . but when he returned to the marina , jordan had slipped away . `` there was no shore line , no hose ; it was like he was never there , '' morris told the station . after he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony . the marina 's manager , jeff weeks , told wpde that jordan is expected to be back at buscksport next week . tales of people who cheated death after days , weeks adrift .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- paul walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production . but walker 's death in november 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the `` fast and furious '' film franchise . the release of `` furious 7 '' on friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in hollywood . `` he was a person of humility , integrity , and compassion , '' military veteran kyle upham said in an email to cnn . walker secretly paid for the engagement ring upham shopped for with his bride . `` we did n't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him . i know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us , '' said upham . the actor was on break from filming `` furious 7 '' at the time of the fiery accident , which also claimed the life of the car 's driver , roger rodas . producers said early on that they would not kill off walker 's character , brian o'connor , a former cop turned road racer . instead , the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes , with walker 's brothers , cody and caleb , serving as body doubles . there are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending , in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to walker while `` retiring '' his character . at the premiere wednesday night in hollywood , walker 's co-star and close friend vin diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening , saying `` this movie is more than a movie . '' `` you 'll feel it when you see it , '' diesel said . `` there 's something emotional that happens to you , where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you 're gon na see them . '' there have been multiple tributes to walker leading up to the release . diesel revealed in an interview with the `` today '' show that he had named his newborn daughter after walker . social media has also been paying homage to the late actor . a week after walker 's death , about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in los angeles . most had never met him . marcus coleman told cnn he spent almost $ 1,000 to truck in a banner from bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial . `` it 's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face , '' coleman said . `` sitting there , bringing his movies into your house or watching on tv , it 's like getting to know somebody . it really , really hurts . '' walker 's younger brother cody told people magazine that he was initially nervous about how `` furious 7 '' would turn out , but he is happy with the film . `` it 's bittersweet , but i think paul would be proud , '' he said . cnn 's paul vercammen contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's the kind of thing you see in movies , like robert redford 's role in `` all is lost '' or ang lee 's `` life of pi . '' but , in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days , weeks , if not months and somehow living to talk about it . miracles do happen , though , and not just in hollywood . we 're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the u.s. coast guard . much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard , if any . in order to survive , they ca n't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city , town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity , resourcefulness and luck . it 's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly , with a sailor dying at sea , except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues . such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says , a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts . below are a few recent examples : . louis jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from south carolina in late january . he headed into the gulf stream looking for a good spot to catch fish . and then everything -- his boat , his life -- turned upside down . rescued man says he is ` utterly thankful ' not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke , jordan said . and so , too , did his shoulder . he bought time by rationing water , then collecting fresh water in a bucket . as to food , jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish . and he rigged a makeshift mast and sail . but , jordan said , `` it took so long . it moved so slowly . '' his sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a german-flagged container ship , the houston express , spotted jordan about 200 miles off the north carolina coast on thursday . after their reunion , his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads . `` i thought i lost you . '' jose salvador alvarenga says his journey began in paredon viejo , a port on mexico 's pacific coast , in late 2012 . the exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in december , locals say it was november . but what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared . until january 2013 . that 's when alvarenga interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the marshall islands . castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in pacific . what was supposed to be a one-day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the pacific ocean , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive . his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course . then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems . four weeks in , alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old ezequiel cordova , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds . the days , weeks and months ran together after that . alvarenga says he drank rainwater and , when there was n't any available , his own urine . he ate sea turtles . then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the ebon atoll , about a 22-hour boat ride from the marshall islands capital of majuro . the atoll has one phone line , no internet service and a few residents , two of whom alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods . the el salvador native told cnn that his faith in god helped him survive . `` i thought , ' i am going to get out , '' he said . `` get out , get out , get out . '' some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement , reining it in a few notches as life slows down . and if you live in hawaii , there 's even more reason to take it easy . the thing is : ron ingraham is n't one of those people . he 's a fisherman . the sea is both his life and livelihood , his son , zakary , told cnn . and he 's tough , with his son jokingly comparing him to rambo . still , even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what ron ingraham went through after setting off around last thanksgiving solo from the hawaiian island of molokai . son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea . after bad weather hit , ron ingraham told cnn affiliate khnl/kgmb that his 25-foot sailboat went `` backwards all night long . '' at one point , a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well . the 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in . but his boat could n't be rescued so easily , leaving him at the mercy of the current . a distress call went out , prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles . when a coast guard official told him the search was being called off december 1 , zakary ingraham responded , `` i do n't feel like he 's dead . i do n't feel it . '' he was right . twelve days after that first distress call , ron ingraham was picked up about 64 miles -lrb- 103 kilometers -rrb- south of honolulu `` weak , hungry and dehydrated '' and -- most importantly -- alive . the veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him . in february 2012 , two friends asked 18-year-old adrian vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition . he said yes , and the three set off from the panama town of san carlos on a small boat , vasquez 's mother , nilsa de la cruz , recalled . things started out well , by all accounts . the three caught plenty of fish . then , their boat 's engine died without warning . and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , the trio did n't know what to do , according to vasquez 's mother . mother calls panama teen 's return ' a miracle ' vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat , the fifty cents , further and further from the coast and into the pacific ocean . somewhere along the way , his two companions died . it 's not clear exactly how , with ecuadorian rear . adm. freddy garcia calle saying vasquez threw their bodies into the sea `` because they had become badly decomposed . '' some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began , fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the galapagos islands . the ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor , who 'd lost 20 pounds and showed `` severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition , '' according to calle . he returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him , but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal . `` for us , this is an opportunity to get closer as a family , '' his mother said by phone , `` to be more understanding and loving . '' sometimes one does n't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled . sometimes people do n't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end . for proof , look no further than hiromitsu shinkawa . 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers . he was at home on march 11 , 2011 , when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of tokyo . a devastating tsunami followed , its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors . by the time it had run the course , nearly 16,000 people were dead . it 's a miracle shinkawa was n't one of them . shortly after the quake , he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of minamisoma . his home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge , powerful tsunami wave . `` i was saved by holding onto the roof , '' the 60-year-old said , according to kyodo news agency . `` but my wife was swept away . ' more than two days later , video showed shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood , shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles -lrb- 15 kilometers -rrb- out to sea . he was waving a self-made red flag . after being spotted by crew aboard a japanese maritime self-defense force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat , he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears , kyodo reported . shinkawa told his rescuers , `` i thought today was the last day of my life . ''

-lrb- cnn -rrb- since iran 's islamic revolution in 1979 , women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men . but the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events . a plan to allow `` women and families '' to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year , deputy sports minister abdolhamid ahmadi said saturday , according to state-run media . but it is n't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend . according to the state-run press tv , ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events . the rules wo n't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and `` families are not interested in attending '' them , press tv cited him as saying . iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men 's sports events after the revolution , deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-islamic . during the ensuing decades , the crowds at soccer games , iran 's most popular sport , have been all male . iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate president mohammad khatami , but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard-line mahmoud ahmadinejad came to power . the iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions . fifa president sepp blatter called on iran last month to end its `` intolerable '' ban on women attending soccer matches , saying the situation `` can not continue . '' iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer 's asian cup , but the tournament was awarded to the united arab emirates . the ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to iran 's chances of securing the event . the ban came under the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction . during the match against iraq , activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami , a british-iranian woman detained in iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match . iranian officials have denied that ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game , saying she was taken into custody for `` anti-iran activities . '' the news agency reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the court of appeal . cnn 's annie ramos contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- easter is a cornerstone event in the christian faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks . it celebrates the completion of christ 's mission of salvation in the crucifixion and resurrection . by dying on good friday , christ atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on sunday , christ conquered death . simple enough and reason for christians to celebrate . but , like christmas with its tree , ornaments and santa claus , easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs . unlike christmas , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events . and that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around easter ? -lrb- no . -rrb- . here 's a journey from the vatican to the holy land , around the moon and the earth 's tilting axis , to germany and the united states to try to explain the complex holiday called easter . and you 'll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool-aid . let 's start at the vatican . at the vatican , holy week began with palm sunday last week and culminated in easter sunday mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of christ 's mortal life . jesus rode on the back of a donkey into jerusalem on palm sunday where crowds celebrated him as the messiah and laid down palm branches in his path . but the crowd and the romans turned on him in the course of the week , according to the bible , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray st. peter 's square on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by pope francis . afterward , the pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his urbi et orbi address . francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . from nigeria to south sudan , iraq to ukraine , he expressed hope that violence would end . francis also does n't put on airs . this week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the biblical account of a woman , a sinner , washing jesus ' feet and anointing them with oil . let 's move on to old jerusalem , the birthplace of easter . the church of the holy sepulcher in old jerusalem unifies the spot where christ was crucified -- calvary -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . on sunday , catholics and armenian christians celebrated the resurrection there . in the morning , the latin patriarch , the archbishop of jerusalem , entered the basilica . then mass was held followed by a procession . but a large group of indigenous christians did n't join them . it 's not quite easter yet in the holy land for eastern orthodox christians . they 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine easter 's date by a different calendar than western christians -- the julian calendar . which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of easter sunday . a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between good friday and easter sunday and during passover . just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both passover -- the jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in egypt -- and easter are determined by moon phases , according to timeanddate.com . easter 's timing is related to passover , because jesus was crucified around then , according to the bible . many jewish holidays , including passover , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with earth 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- passover 's exact date moves around -- and so does easter 's . when christian bishops first convened at the council of nicaea in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of easter , so as to fairly reliably pin it to passover : . it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . that 's the day in march when earth 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , easter would be pushed down a week . confusing ? it got worse . when the west moved from the julian calendar to the gregorian calendar , orthodox christians stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for easter . in 1997 , the world council of churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . it did n't catch on . but some odd easter trappings that popped up after the middle ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . the bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon . that 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . german immigrants appear to have brought it to north america in the 1700s . german historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . professor of medicine georg franck von frankenau described in his paper `` de ovis paschalibus , '' or `` on easter eggs , '' a custom in the alsace region involving a bunny and eggs , according to german public television . some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree . but von frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in germany . one common idea : during lent , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . by the time easter rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the easter eggs came from . if you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip . instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use kool-aid , youtube science geek grant thompson suggests . and it appears to work . just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . but be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , thompson warns . that 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it . happy easter ! happy passover !

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world 's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two-year shutdown . after problems that delayed the restart in march , scientists at the european organization for nuclear research -lrb- cern -rrb- completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating sunday inside the lhc 's 17 mile -lrb- 27 km -rrb- ring . `` operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what cern 's here for , '' cern director-general rolf heuer said on the organization 's website . `` today , cern 's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the lhc . '' the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles -lrb- more than 10 billion kilometers -rrb- -- the distance from earth to neptune and back again . at near light-speed , a proton in the lhc makes 11,245 circuits per second . it took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator , housed in a tunnel between lake geneva and the jura mountain range . the purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the `` big bang '' -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe . by replicating the energy density and temperature , scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved . our current , limited , knowledge is based on what 's called the standard model of particle physics . `` but we know that this model is not complete , '' dr. mike lamont , operations group leader at the lhc , told cnn in march . the burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy , while others have no mass at all ; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity ; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy , since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe . the lhc could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the big bang . cern says the energies achievable by the lhc have only ever been found in nature . the machine alone costs approximately three billion euros -lrb- about $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , paid for by member countries of cern and contributions by non-member nations . the organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by swiss and french laws and a european council directive . scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the lhc ventures into the great unknown . `` after two years of effort , the lhc is in great shape , '' said cern director for accelerators and technology , frédérick bordry . `` but the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels . '' peter shadbolt contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- residents of central sanaa , the yemeni capital , have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors . and fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks . the saudi-led coalition smashed parts of yemen 's defense ministry central command in the capital over the weekend , senior yemeni officials said . under the rain of coalition bombs , the houthis , who are shiites in a majority sunni country , still control sanaa . but the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure . the electricity has gone out on 16 million yemenis living in houthi-held areas , the yemeni officials said . many fear they will lose access to clean water as well . yemen 's deposed president abdu rabu mansour hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes . he fired his former army chief of staff , hussein khairan , on sunday . the firing had no practical effect , since khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the houthi rebels ' acting defense minister . hadi is holed up in saudi arabia , which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him . fighting has ended dozens of lives each day . on monday , more than 50 people died in the port city of aden alone , where houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to hadi on the ground , agence france-press reported . since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago , some 600 people are estimated to have been killed . many more have been wounded , and tens of thousands have fled the country . the international committee of the red cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in . `` otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die . for the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days , '' said robert mardini , the icrc 's head of operations in the near and middle east . `` medical supplies need to be here yesterday , '' said icrc spokeswoman marie-claire feghali from sanaa . `` we need to save the lives that can be saved . '' saudi arabia signed off on letting the icrc into yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies , the other with workers . but flying in will be hard , since most airlines have canceled their flights , and airstrikes have taken out many airfields . on monday , the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in djibouti , feghali said . the icrc is hoping to fly out in a day or two . following the icrc 's call , on saturday the u.n. security council discussed the humanitarian situation at russia 's behest . moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition . the meeting adjourned with no decision announced . one diplomat said the draft was missing key elements . it did n't call for the houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told cnn on condition of anonymity . yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced hadi from power . the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january . but hadi escaped in february , fled to aden and declared himself to still be president . houthis and their allies , including those loyal to hadi 's predecessor , then fought hadi 's forces in the aden area . hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . the conflict prompted saudi arabia , a predominately sunni nation and yemen 's northern neighbor , and other arab nations to intervene with force . the houthis are allied with iran , saudi arabia 's bitter rival across the persian gulf , and riyadh does not want an proxy of iran in power on its border . complicating matters in yemen is the fact that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -- not the houthis or the forces loyal to hadi -- holds sway in the country 's east . aqap is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . it has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail . hadi 's government had cooperated with the united states to fight aqap , but with the houthi takeover , that arrangement has evaporated , and the terror group operates generally unchecked .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion , especially in indiana , where its new religious freedom restoration act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people . such state laws have been growing ever since the u.s. religious freedom restoration act became law in 1993 , designed to prohibit the federal government from `` substantially burdening '' a person 's exercise of religion . so far , 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law , and the legal controversies have grown , too . nonetheless , claims under those state rfras are `` exceedingly rare , '' and victories involved mostly religious minorities , not christian denominations , experts say . `` there is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers , '' wrote wayne state university law professor christopher lund in a 2010 analysis , when there were only 16 states with such laws . here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws , touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an irs accountant to a tea from the amazon : . he was a native american with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes . but not in the eyes of the feds . in 2006 , robert soto and michael russell attended an american indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers , in violation of the federal eagle protection act , which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground . soto , a lipan apache , asserted he was participating in an indian religious ceremony . the feathers are sacred to native americans . but a federal fish and wildlife service agent found his tribe was n't federally recognized , and soto surrendered his feathers . russell , who is married to soto 's sister , is n't american indian and agreed to pay a fine , according to court papers and the america bar association journal . soto , however , petitioned the federal interior department to return his feathers . the feds said no , because he was n't from a recognized tribe . soto and russell sued the federal government , but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government , rejecting the two men 's first amendment assertions and their claims under the federal religious freedom restoration act , the same 1993 statute that indiana legislators used in developing their new state law . but last august , the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals reversed the trial court 's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government 's action would violate the federal rfra . on march 10 , the federal government returned the eagle feathers to soto . but the legal war is n't over . the federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute soto and his congregants , so soto is seeking a preliminary injunction , claiming the feds are violating the federal rfra , said luke goodrich , soto 's attorney who 's with the becket fund for religious liberty . a tea used by a brazilian faith is to them like wine used by catholics at communion , but u.s. agents considered the brew an illegal drug . the religious organization o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca , made from two plants native to the amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine , a hallucinogen , in violation of the controlled substances act . the religion is a christian spiritist faith that originated in brazil and includes amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions . about 140 members of the church live in the united states and use the tea in a sacred communion . in may 1999 , u.s. customs agents entered the church headquarters in santa fe , new mexico , and seized all of its hoasca . the church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for american indians to use another illegal drug , peyote , in their religious ceremonies . in fact , the federal rfra was designed partly to protect the native americans ' use of peyote , said cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin . `` they were a legitimate religion , and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion , and congress wanted to make sure it was protected , '' toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law . the uniao do vegetal , which means `` the union of the plants , '' cited that federal law in suing the federal government . `` the government has never explained why it has accommodated the native american church 's use of peyote -lrb- which contains mescaline , also a controlled substance -rrb- but can not accommodate the udv 's use of hoasca , '' the church said in a statement . the u.s. supreme court ruled in the church 's favor , saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use . `` the peyote exception also fatally undermines the government 's broader contention that the controlled substances act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under rfra , '' the court ruling said . bruce rich , an orthodox jewish prisoner in florida , wanted kosher meals , but the warden said no . so rich sued the state prison system in 2010 , saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000 , a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law . rich , 66 , is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents , in their 70s , in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home . the prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns , namely `` retaliation against the kosher inmates '' if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food , court papers said . at least 35 other states and the federal government , however , provided kosher diets to inmates . after losing before a magistrate , rich won an appeal before the 11th circuit court , which cited `` the defendant 's meager efforts to explain why florida 's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in florida . '' recently baptized in the sikh faith , kawal tagore went to her job with the irs in houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item : a 9-inch kirpan , a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved . tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith . but the federal government banned her from the building , citing the kirpan as a `` dangerous weapon '' with a more than 3-inch blade , and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace . tagore sued the government under the federal law . tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects : real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes , said her attorneys with the newar law firm and the becket fund . also , federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives . in november , the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of tagore 's trial . the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing , the christian science monitor reported . tagore 's attorneys described the settlement as `` a groundbreaking policy allowing sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings , '' they said in a statement . invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes does n't always equate to victory . in chicago , an association of 40 churches called the civil liberties for urban believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones . the ministers needed a special use permit , but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one , the church leaders claimed . in fact , it was easier to get a club , lodge or community center approved . so the pastors sued the city of chicago in 2000 , alleging that its zoning laws violated the illinois religious freedom statute , the federal religious land use and institutionalized persons act and the u.s. constitution . but in 2003 , the 7th circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group 's claims , finding no substantial burden on the churches , which also failed to establish their rluipa claim . defeated , church leaders were angry . `` the forty -lrb- 40 -rrb- churches in c.l.u.b. and certainly people of all faiths throughout chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the religious land use and institutionalized persons act passed unanimously by congress in 2000 , '' apostle theodore wilkinson , the group 's chairman , said in a statement . `` also alarming is the court 's conclusion that chicago 's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws . the majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing , '' he said . at the same time , the city of chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid `` the threat of heightened scrutiny under rluipa , '' according to a league of california cities report in 2002 . cnn 's alexandra meeks contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president . reaching a good , solid agreement with iran is a worthy , desirable goal . but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening america 's hand and strengthening iran . obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it . there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months . the reason is that obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations . the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b. few believe it , particularly in the middle east and notably among america 's arab friends , who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed obama . as the writer david rothkopf aptly put it , `` iran is having a great obama administration . '' that 's a belief that has already started shaking up the region . saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among iran 's muslim rivals will do the same . in fact , the notion that obama is not handling the iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in yemen , where saudi arabia and other arabs are trying to push back against gains by iran 's allies . we can trace it all back to the democratic primaries in 2007 , when then-sen . obama said he would meet iran 's leaders `` without preconditions , '' leading his rival , hillary clinton , to call the idea `` irresponsible and frankly naive . '' as the years of his presidency unfolded , and the middle east started coming apart , finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement obama might leave behind . the political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace . the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after obama 's march 31 deadline . the u.s.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the united states , and the french ambassador very publicly decried as a `` bad tactic . '' that bad tactic was a political move , a push to produce some sort of result , however vague , to protect the talks from critics . again , a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development . but the agreement so far does not look promising . it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what obama had vowed . in a presidential debate in 2012 , obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations . `` the deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . it 's very straightforward . '' nobody is talking about iran ending its nuclear program . not even close . iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges . that 's not a small symbolic number . and it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled , although fordow will contain no nuclear materials . iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses . the fact is that iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to u.n. inspectors . and the u.n. agency chief says that has not stopped . a couple of weeks ago , with days left until the negotiating deadline , u.n. nuclear chief yukiya amano said iran is still stonewalling . `` we are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is -lsb- for a -rsb- peaceful purpose , '' he warned . the negotiations ' starting point is that iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably , forever . the world only learned about iran 's secret facilities at arak and natanz after dissidents raised the alarm . iran , we have learned repeatedly , is very good at lying to international inspectors . it is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program . it is well-established that many of iran 's neighbors do n't trust it and are anxious about the u.s.-led international dealings with iran . it is well-established that iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region . it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring iran to the negotiating table . it was iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks . but political considerations turned the united states into the supplicant . the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon . nuclear enrichment will continue , although at a lower level . iran officially , legally , becomes a nuclear threshold state , with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a `` breakout '' period of one year , the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act . even the fordow facility , conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain , will remain in existence , though `` converted '' to a nuclear `` research facility '' and without nuclear material on site . international sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately . its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place , even if operating at a reduced pace , giving iran much of what it wanted . with iranian forces gaining ground in arab lands and iranian commanders declaring the destruction of israel `` nonnegotiable '' and threatening saudi arabia , this deal does not look reassuring . obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option . but the deal so far looks like -lrb- another -rrb- win for iran . it introduces enough restrictions that it could give the president the political cover he wants , but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the middle east .

'' in a statement , illinois state university president larry dietz remembered ward and leetch as `` well-respected and much-loved colleagues in our athletics department '' in the crash near bloomington . `` words can not fully express the grief that is felt in the wake of such a tragedy , '' dietz said . `` we move between shock and profound sadness . '' a standout player at the university of alabama at birmingham in his hometown between 1996 and 2000 , ward played professionally in china alongside yao ming before getting into coaching . he was part of the staffs at jacksonsville state university , the university of mississippi and , for one year , in china before coming to illinois state as an assistant prior to the 2012 season . he was promoted to associate head coach in may 2014 , according to his official bio . coming from arkansas state university , leetch joined isu in 2005 as an athletic director for development before assuming a number of other roles through 2011 , his bio notes . leetch left the illinois school to serve as director of athletics at whitworth university in spokane , washington , then came back in june 2013 as isu 's deputy director of athletics . he was in charge of the redbirds ' athletics communications and video production units , and had a hands-on role in its football , men 's basketball , golf and baseball programs . athletic director larry lyons described leetch as `` a shining star in the business , '' while lauding ward as `` a talented coach and recruiter '' with a big personality who was loved by fans . `` there is no play in the playbook for times like these , '' lyons said . `` we will miss aaron and torrey deeply , and we will support their families in any way that we can . '' people we 've lost in 2015 .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- after deliberating for more than 35 hours over parts of seven days , listening intently to the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and reviewing more than 400 pieces of evidence , the teary-eyed men and women of the jury exchanged embraces . since late january , their work in the massachusetts murder trial of former nfl star aaron hernandez had consumed their lives . it was nothing like `` law & order . '' the days were long and tedious . now it was over . `` it 's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us , '' lesa strachan told cnn 's anderson cooper thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury . a day earlier , strachan , the jury foreperson , announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of hernandez 's onetime friend odin lloyd . strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots . `` you shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times . there 's no need for that and there 's no need to use a gun . period . '' before the trial , at least one juror -- rosalie oliver -- had n't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $ 40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison . but kelly dorsey watches the patriots every sunday during the football season . she said so on her jury questionnaire . `` i knew of him as a football player , not a person , '' she said . it did n't affect her vote to convict , she said . it did n't matter that he was a football player , she said . nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder . `` to leave your friend on the ground , knowing that he 's not there anymore -- he 's either dead or he 's going to die -- that 's indifference , '' dorsey said of hernandez . `` he did n't need to pull the trigger . '' that word -- `` indifference '' -- was used multiple times by members of the jury . jon carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying , drinking smoothies . hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men . that indifference `` surprised a lot of us , '' carlson said . he stressed the fact that hernandez played football for a living did n't influence the jury 's decision . `` it does n't matter how much money you have or how much money you make . we 're all people , and we 're all equal , and we all deserve the same fair trial , and that 's what we wanted to make sure we gave him , '' carlson said . lloyd was seen june 17 , 2013 , around 2:30 a.m. with hernandez and hernandez 's friends , carlos ortiz and ernest wallace , in a rented silver nissan altima . later that day , a jogger found his body . he had been shot six times , according to prosecutors . wallace and ortiz , who were also charged with murder , have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . what 's next for aaron hernandez ? rosalie oliver -- the juror who had n't heard of hernandez before the trial -- said that , for her , the first shot was enough . `` there was no need for the other five , '' she said . `` one shot for me is cruelty . '' oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict . `` who won ? '' she asked `` odin lloyd did n't win . -lrb- his mother -rrb- did n't bring back her son . did mr. hernandez win ? no , because he 's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he 's 25 years old . the worst part for me is : how about that little girl that 's never going to see her father again ? '' what prison life will be like for aaron hernandez . oliver recalled making eye contact with hernandez at one point during the months-long trial . `` he actually nodded to me one time , '' she said . `` you come in that room every day and you see this person and it 's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it 's almost like they 're part of you . and then , all of a sudden now , you 've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go . '' the jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room , choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial . they conveyed a sense of gravity about their task . `` you see , you know , ` law & order ' and all these different tv shows and it 's just nothing like that at all . it 's just very serious , '' carlson said . 5 things to know about the jury .

has this brilliant 79th masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on sunday ? no-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round , when the three biggest names in the sport combined with justin rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old texan jordan spieth . the young american coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage . but there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to rose but masters specialist phil mickelson , who will start five behind . spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round . it worked out perfectly for tiger woods in 1997 but not so well for rory mcilroy in 2011 , who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes . ` i think jordan will cope better than i did because he was in the final group last year , ' said mcilroy . ` i certainly expect him to cope a lot better than i did . ' jordan spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the masters . at 16 under par , spieth broke the record shared by ray floyd and tiger woods by a single shot . the other thing spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round . he won one and finished runner-up in the other two . if he wins , he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun . spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play . but while rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes , spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th . and at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three , before spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous masters sunday . plucky journeyman charley hoffman lies fourth while woods and mcilroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on sunday . but at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind . as for rose , the 2013 us open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish . pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th , where he holed a spectacular bunker shot . ` i think it 's important to be in the final group , it 's where you want to be , ' said the 34 year old englishman . ` jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but i have definitely given myself an opportunity . ' world no 1 rory mcilroy and 14-time major winner tiger woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . finally , the real mcilroy showed upon the par fives at augusta on saturday . what a day we had on saturday . it was as if rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared : ` ok , let 's see if this kid jordan is really destined for greatness . ' for those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket , we had mcilroy playing like the world number one and tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream . there was the glorious sight of mickelson playing once more like he owns augusta . and then there was rose , who has had a lot of good days at augusta in his ten masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more . how would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror , at this of all courses ? in short , for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in spieth 's direction . this was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round . just as well , then , that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be : ' whenever the heat is on , ensure you focus just that little bit more . ' and that , for the most part , is just what he did . only at the end did he look like stumbling , but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat . tiger woods put on a vintage show , he was astonishing , electric , inspired and charismatic . woods ' girlfriend lindsey vonn showed her support during the third round on saturday . the previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by ray floyd in 1976 and woods in 1997 . but the youngest first round leader in masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on friday had reached 16 under after a 70 . what made this so impressive was that , for the first time , a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game . during the round he would have three three putts and his first double . when things like this happen here it 's so easy for the mind to unravel but spieth kept his composure . at the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth . at the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot , from a downhill lie to an elevated green . spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots . in its own way , this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds . so it continued . the two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag . you can guess what happened next , and he birdied the 13th as well . he would threeputt the 14th , however -- and then came the next test . phil mickelson played like the masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . justin rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . as he made his way down the 15th fairway , first mickelson and then rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures . how would he respond ? well , at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie . best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie . mcilroy , woods and mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots . mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of arnold palmer . some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and mickelson was doing justice to the memory . eight strokes off the pace at the start of play , he 's still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today . add mcilroy 's wonderful back nine 31 from friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday , and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63 . amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round . so tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake , it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided : ` to hell with it , let 's go for it . ' finally , the real mcilroy showed up on the par fives , those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years . an eagle at the 13th on friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round . he was off and running . he birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the masters . a poor eight iron to the 16th cost him , however , as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably . another bogey at the last as well meant a 68 . and so the likely list of winners stands at just three -- spieth , rose and mickelson . it should be some final day . it has been some tournament .

lewis hamilton led the way in both practice sessions for sunday 's chinese grand prix . hamilton suggested mercedes will be back in control for this race after ferrari and sebastian vettel conjured one of the surprises for many a season with the team 's first victory for almost two years at the last race in malaysia . many people expected another dominant mercedes campaign in the wake of last season 's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in australia . lewis hamilton was fastest in both practice sessions for this weekend 's chinese grand prix . the briton , mobbed by fans in the paddock , is bidding to win his fourth chinese grand prix . 1 . lewis hamilton mercedes 1:37.219 . 2 . kimi raikkonen ferrari 1:37.662 . 3 . daniel ricciardo red bull - renault 1:38.311 . 4 . sebastian vettel ferrari 1:38.339 . 5 . nico rosberg mercedes 1:38.399 . 6 . daniil kvyat red bull - renault 1:38.737 . 7 . valtteri bottas williams-mercedes 1:38.850 . 8 . felipe nasr sauber - ferrari 1:39.032 . 9 . romain grosjean lotus - mercedes 1:39.142 . 10 . jenson button mclaren 1:39.275 . 11 . pastor maldonado lotus - mercedes 1:39.444 . 12 . fernando alonso mclaren 1:39.743 . 13 . marcus ericsson sauber - ferrari 1:39.751 . 14 . max verstappen toro rosso - renault 1:39.894 . 15 . carlos sainz jr toro rosso - renault 1:39.971 . 16 . nico hulkenberg force india - mercedes 1:40.151 . 17 . felipe massa williams-mercedes 1:40.423 . 18 . sergio perez force india - mercedes 1:40.868 . 19 . roberto merhi marussia - ferrari 1:42.973 . 20 . will stevens marussia - ferrari 1:44.564 . even mercedes motorsport boss toto wolff suggested ferrari 's success was ' a wake-up call ' to his organisation . without doubt mercedes , and hamilton in particular , responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team-mate nico rosberg at the end of fp1 when pirelli 's medium-compound tyre was used . switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in fp2 , hamilton again comfortably had the edge by 0.443 secs over ferrari 's kimi raikkonen . red bull 's daniel ricciardo was third quickest , 1.093 secs adrift , but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues . it is yet to be determined whether they were the same problems that ultimately brought an end to team-mate daniil kvyat 's day . as the young russian exited the pits with 20 minutes remaining his brakes caught fire , and although kvyat attempted to return , he was eventually forced to pull off track . felipe massa trudges off the track after his spin brought out the red flags during the second practice session . the brazilian inspects his williams after he locked up on the approach to turn 14 before losing the back end . vettel was fourth on the timesheet , 1.120 secs down , with rosberg fifth after making a mistake on his fast lap on the soft tyres . kvyat still ended up sixth , followed by the williams of valtteri bottas , sauber 's felipe nasr and romain grosjean in his lotus . mclaren 's jenson button completed the top 10 , two seconds down as he and the team continue to show signs of improvement , with team-mate fernando alonso 12th and a further half a second off the pace . felipe massa 's session , meanwhile , lasted 38 minutes as the williams driver skidded off the track at the end of the longest straight in f1 . daniil kvyat 's brakes caught fire when he left the pits and the red bull driver ended up in the gravel . fernando alonso looks on from the back of the mclaren garage ... he ended the second session in 12th . the brazilian locked up on the approach to turn 14 , losing the back end of the car and resulting in a slide on to the run-off area where he lost the left front-wing endplate after clipping a barrier . although massa managed to keep the engine running and reversed his car , the endplate lodged under the left-front tyre , forcing him to abandon . it resulted in the session being red-flagged for the car 's retrieval , with massa ultimately finishing down in 17th . manor duo roberto merhi and will stevens brought up the rear , the latter encountering issues with his power unit in fp2 which restricted him to just six laps . stevens will be hoping the problem can be resolved as he has already missed qualifying and the race in both australia and malaysia due to other difficulties . sebastian vettel , winner at the malaysian grand prix last time out , was fourth quickest in the second session .

manchester city 's problems are not confined to the barclays premier league . over the pond , new york city fc manager jason kreis is finding life increasingly difficult following a patchy start to the season which continued on thursday night as philadelphia union snatched a late draw in a match which had been bossed for long periods by the men in sky blue . the pressure has n't reached manuel pellegrini proportions . it 's too early for that . new york city fc 's mehdi ballouchy opened the scoring before his side were pegged back . yet kreis and nycfc will be under no illusions about the task in hand . things need to improve . and fast . a superb second half strike from mehdi ballouchy looked to have put an end to a run of just one win from the first five matches . but , as is ever the case in mls , haphazard defending allowed cj sapong to stab in on 86 minutes . as long as david villa stays fit - he came off at halftime with a hamstring strain here - and the squad continues to gel , frank lampard will arrive here in the summer and join a side who slowly but surely will have adapted to the task in hand by then . this though was a reminder of how much work needs to be done . the big apple sports fans have been quick to adopt city 's plans though it will take more time -- and a more wins -- for the club to really catch light . they will never , and do n't expect to compare to the might of the yankees , knicks , jets or giants . they are sporting titans in a city bursting with stars . certainly a look around yankees stadium at kick-off was all you needed to see that the initial spike of interest in nycfc has quickly dimmed . david villa was forced off with a hamstring injury at half time on thursday night . the opening game attendance of over 60,000 seemed like a hazy distant memory . it 's another reminder , not that the club bosses required one , of the desperate need for a permanent football specific home . but , to be fair , as the game wore on the atmosphere and excitement was enough to leave the attendees wanting more even if the league itself does little to help the product on the pitch . mls needs to start acknowledging international breaks like everyone else . city ' s mix diskerud , arguably their best player thus far , was unavailable having played for the us in their win over mexico on wednesday night while the likes robbie keane missed league matches during the last round of euro 2016 qualifier . that can not help the progress of the game here . another quirk this side of the pond saw philadelphia lock horns with kreis ' side just four days after beating them at home 2-1 . it 's perhaps an attempt to recreate the mini-series of matches like in baseball . city , though , created nothing of note early on . david villa 's second mls strike in philadelphia had brought his side level before vincent nogueira slotted home a late winner yet the spanish star was feeding off scraps here . indeed the chances were falling at the other end of the pitch , venezuelan striker fernando aristeguieta firing just over to keep the stuttering home side firmly on their toes . villa sparked into life every time the ball fell at his feet yet his markers were n't giving an inch . three surrounded the former barcelona forward on 25 minutes and after he was ushered out of play , full-back sheanon williams needed no invitation to get stuck into the spaniard by pushing his square in the chest . new york city have made a slow start to the mls season , winning just once . it was handbags at best . yet it showed just how wary union were of villa 's class . and on 27 minutes , the first moment of magic should have resulted in the opener . a sweet flick from the 33 year-old beautifully teed up ballouchy only for the moroccan to blaze over . he really should have scored . it goes without saying that villa was emphatically the best player on the pitch . a canny dummy helped split the philadelphia backline in half but khiry shelton could n't get round keeper john mccarthy . kreis needed the rest of the team to start performing after the break though . and , to their credit , they did . ned grabavoy was denied by mccarthy 's outstretched leg before adam nemec headed wide . finally there was some urgency and on 57 minutes , there was a goal . it was a superb strike by ballouchy who cut inside with an excellent first touch before curling home . philadelphia though , home of rocky balboa , stayed strong before delivering that late knock-out blow . perhaps kreis should give pellegrini a call at some point soon . both are enduring tough times .

rafa nadal got his clay court season off to a perfect , confidence-boosting start with a 6-2 , 6-1 win over frenchman lucas pouille in the monte carlo masters . it was a businesslike display from the world no 5 . he did n't unleash the full power of his forehand but played sensible , measured tennis and made only five unforced errors in the match . his talented 21-year-old opponent showed flashes of attacking flair , including one outrageous half-volley forehand winner , but was never able to put enough balls in court to trouble the great spaniard . rafael nadal safely made his way into third round of the monte carlo masters with win against lucas pouille . nadal got his clay court season off to the perfect start with a straight sets victory 6-2 , 6-1 . nadal broke in the sixth game of the match to go 4-2 up , and a shanked backhand from the world no 108 handed him another break and the first set . the nine-time french open winner began the second set in the same steady form and broke pouille twice to serve for the match at 5-1 . he arrowed a vintage forehand down the line to seal a place in the third round , where he will face either john isner or viktor troicki . the spaniard is an eight-time champion in monte carlo , but has not won here since 2012 and said last week that he is ` not the favourite for anything ' at the moment . frenchman pouille showed glimpses of his talent but was unable to trouble nadal . nadal is an eight-time champion at monte carlo but has n't won the tournament since 2012 . this victory was the first step in rebuilding his self-belief after disappointing losses in the quarter-finals of the indian wells masters and the third round in miami last month . it is too early to say that the king of clay is back to his best , and he will face sterner tests later in the week , but he could not have asked for a better opening display .

the fulham fans in the jimmy steed stand applauded their team at the final whistle . it was not the victory manager kit symons had called for but a point away to charlton probably secures their future in the championship next season . they are eight points clear of millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the premier league last season is alarming . a vertiginous decline , just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals brentford last week , symons was looking for a quick response from his players . johann gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as charlton come from behind to earn a point . the icelandic winger is joined by his charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at the valley . he got it with ross mccormack giving them the lead after eight minutes . a superb long ball by michael turner found matt smith who headed on to the scotsman to loop the ball over the top of charlton goalkeeper stephen henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the jimmy seed stand . the passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling charlton fans harbour towards scott parker . the midfielder , who missed the brentford game through illness , departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos . not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages , feeding striker smith well . ross mccormack headed over a stranded stephen henderson with just eight minutes played in london . mccormack celebrates his goal in front of the traveling fulham fans with just eight minutes played . charlton athletic : henderson , gomez , ben haim , johnson , fox , johann gudmundsson , cousins , diarra , bulot -lrb- eagles 70 -rrb- vetokele -lrb- church 79 -rrb- watt . subs : bikey amougou , wiggins , lennon , dmitrovic , lepoint . fulham : bettinelli , hoogland , burn , turner , husband , parker , tunnicliffe , guthrie , -lrb- kacaniklic 68 -rrb- , kavanagh -lrb- ruiz 68 -rrb- , smith , mccormack . subs : kiraly , stafylidis , woodrow , rodallega , donnelly . but charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser . morgan fox 's cross bounced across the front of goal and frederic bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect . it was left for a waiting johann gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner . goalkeeper marcus bettinelli , who seemed rooted to the spot , wisely dragged a furious james husband , who seemed to believe the goal offside , from a confrontation with the linesman . almost the whole stadium thought gudmundsson had nabbed his second when igor vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss , hitting the side netting instead . the second half was low in quality but high in chances . the visitors seemed reenergised after the interval , forcing a save in the 46th minute . matt smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint james husband cross but henderson did well to thwart the effort . charlton soon asserted control with tony watt going close three times before parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge . the charlton players were outraged when referee andy madley awarded fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but mccormack blasted the ball over the bar . joseph gomez and dan burn fight for the ball during match between charlton athletic and fulham . fulham now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow london rivals millwall , but symons is refusing to relax just yet . he said : ` we 're definitely not safe until it 's mathematically sure because this league is topsy turvy at both ends and it is going to go to the wire . ` but i ca n't be greedy so i will take the point and i was pleased with the performance . ' tony watt skips past danny gutherie during the sky bet championship match the valley .

a parody video that mocks american skiers and plays on stereotypes about us tourists has gone viral on the internet , but not all viewers are finding it amusing . the profanity-laced comedy sketch by 26 minutes , a news satire programme broadcast by radio television suisse , follows ` jeff randl ' , who travels to switzerland to compete in xtreme verbier . with more than 300,000 views on youtube since late march , some viewers said they were offended or did n't find the humour in the show 's over-the-top depiction of americans on the slopes in switzerland . the comedy sketch follows ` jeff randl ' , who travels to ` sweden ' to compete in xtreme verbier . jeff , portrayed by one of the french-language show 's presenters , is a blonde , mop-haired snowboarder who tells the camera he has travelled from lake forest , california to ` sweden ' to compete in the freeriding event . the bible-toting and pot-smoking character plays on the usual stereotypes about us tourists -- from being loud and inconsiderate to arrogant and less worldly . scenes show jeff smoking a ` joint ' while travelling up the mountain on a gondola , saying ` excuse me , i 'm american ' as he pushes his way past other skiers or snowboarders , and barrelling down the slopes without care or caution . at one point , jeff tells the camera : ` sweden , i think that 's one of the 50 states of europe or something . i do n't like it too much here , you do n't give a s *** what people are saying . ' jeff -lrb- right -rrb- offends others by being loud , jumping queues and smoking marijuana on a gondola . he later takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola , saying : ` hey , this machine is gay . i do n't like it . ' the end of the video shows jeff being buried in an ` avalanche ' and pulling his bible out of his jacket . when he is hauled out of the snow by a rescue team , he believes he is saved by god and shouts : ` i 'm american , and god bless america . ' the video has received mixed reviews on youtube , although the majority of comments appear to be from those who found humour in the satire . the snowboarder takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola at the swiss ski resort of verbier . of the negative reviews , one viewer wrote : ` kind of offended by this , definitely not entertained . pretty poorly thought out satire . ' another said : ` still trying to find the funny in this . ' of those who found it funny , one viewer said : ` i 'm an american ... and i freaking love this ' . another wrote : ` got ta love the bible toting californian surfer dude who snowboards ... all it needed was for him to eat a big mac . ' jeff holds his bible after he was ` buried ' in an avalanche and pulled from the snow by rescuers . comedian vincent kucholl , who played the role of jeff , told swiss newspaper le matin that he has enjoyed seeing the response from americans , and he rejected suggestions that the sketch was racist . he said : ` it 's funny that they are reacting ... but we did nothing wrong . this was for people here , not in america . ' he told the newspaper that viewers ' reactions suggests that americans have less self-deprecating humour than the swiss .

' sherwood was understandably in bullish mood after the landmark victory in only his 10th match as villa boss and when asked how much he is enjoying life in the midlands he replied : `` well it 's going all right at the moment . the victorious villa side celebrate their fa cup semi-final triumph at the final whistle . `` we 're delighted with that obviously . we were the underdogs today but we believed in there that we could win it and i think we outplayed liverpool to be honest . `` we kept the ball off them , created lots of chances and they resorted to lumping the ball into our area in the last 10 minutes so you know you are doing something right when they 're doing that . '' the former tottenham boss , who played a key role in the development of harry kane , also reserved special praise for 19-year-old winger jack grealish . he was a constant threat down the left for villa and was involved in the build-up play that led to delph 's winning goal . `` he could be right up there amongst the best of them . the ball is his friend . he likes to receive it he does n't look at it , he knows where it is , he shifts it , he 's got a turn of foot , takes a lot of knocks , but he can take it . he 's a big lad , '' sherwood said . `` he 's aston villa through and through . he lives a couple of miles from the ground , he just wants to play for the club and i want to give him the platform to do that because he 's earned the right .

' james is nearly 16 , and i 'm painfully aware that my years of holidaying with him are coming to a close . my last choices all ended in teenage snits . then a friend suggested a back-to-nature break in poland . unknown : wigry national park , in north-east poland , is the furthest outreach of the masurian lakes . our destination is wigry national park , in the north-east of the country , close to the lithuanian border . it is the furthest outreach of the masurian lakes -lrb- poland 's lake district -rrb- , and the most sparsely populated . our base is an unassuming but pristine hotel right on the wigry lakeshore . the national park snuggles around it , a mass of primeval forest and waterways that are home to otter and beaver , wolf and elk . the area is unspoiled , but it is also exceedingly well set-up for outdoorsy pursuits . the hotel rents mountain bikes and nordic walking poles , and you could cycle or hike for days around the well-marked trails . come and discover : the area is unspoiled , but it is also exceedingly well set-up for outdoor pursuits . or you can take to the water . whichever way you turn , there is another beach , another jetty , another twisting corner of wigry -- the name means ` winding ' -- and it has the longest and most meandering shoreline of all of poland 's lakes . the food is solid , verging on stolid , big piles of comfort stacked high and priced low -- a lightweight # 3 a plate . we need the calories , with the amount of exercise we are notching up . we cycle through the forest , keeping a hopeful eye out for wildlife . but we are too noisy , what with our clanking gears and my muffled grunts as i hit yet another tree root . a holiday of an old-fashioned kind : jane found a refreshing simplicity to this pretty corner of poland . it is all so wholesome that , as we sit by another pristine lake , watching the sun dip down , i find myself singing old campfire songs as james takes another swim . the place has somehow transported me back to my own teens , to a time when holidays did not need to be sophisticated . ` you know what ? i 've loved this holiday , ' says james , as we sit for the last time on the hotel jetty , sharing a bar of chocolate and watching the stars . i ca n't argue . ` me too , ' i tell him . a wealth of water and wow factor : jane chose the region for an active holiday with her teenage son . ryanair -lrb- 0871 246 0000 , www.ryanair.com -rrb- flies from stansted to kaunas from # 49 return . double rooms at the hotel nad wigrami , gawrych ruda -lrb- 0048 87 563 59 59 , www.hotelnadwigrami.pl -rrb- cost from # 50 per night b&b . mountain bikes and kayaks can be hired . for more on wigry national park , visit www.wigry.win.pl .

born-again christian victoria wasteney has launched an appeal after she was given a written warning for praying for a muslim colleague and inviting her to church events . a devout christian has launched an appeal against an employment tribunal which found she had ` bullied ' a muslim colleague by praying for her and inviting her to church . victoria wasteney , 38 , says she was branded a ` religious nutcase ' when she was suspended from her job as a senior occupational therapist , after her colleague enya nawaz , then aged 25 , accused her of trying to convert her to christianity . her lawyers have now submitted a challenge to an employment tribunal , arguing that they broke the law by restricting her freedom of conscience and religion - enshrined in article nine of the european convention of human rights . miss wasteney , a born-again christian , was working at the st john howard centre in homerton , east london , when she became friendly with a junior colleague miss nawaz . the two women had discussed islam and christianity , as well as the work done by her church at the christian revival church in the o2 arena in greenwich against human trafficking . when miss nawaz was upset about health problems , miss wasteney said she offered to pray for her -- putting her hand on her knee and asking god for ` peace and healing ' . she also invited her to church events and gave her colleague a book , i dared to call him father , about a muslim woman who converts to christianity , but denied she was trying to make miss nawaz convert . miss nawaz went onto make a formal complaint , and the east london nhs foundation trust suspended ms wasteney on full pay from her # 50,000-a-year job for nine months while they investigated in june 2013 . a disciplinary hearing upheld three complaints about the book , the invitation to attend church and miss wasteney 's offer to pray for miss nawaz , and gave her a written warning for misconduct . she continues to work for the trust , but not in her specialist field . she launched her own employment tribunal against the nhs in january , saying she wanted to raise awareness about the increasing difficulties experienced by religious people in the workplace and claiming the organisation had failed to clear her of wrong doing because it would be ` politically incorrect ' to find a christian innocent . speaking in january to the daily mail miss wasteney said : ` i 'm not anti-muslim and i 'm always very mindful to be sensitive to other people 's beliefs . the senior occupational therapist put her hand on her muslim colleague 's knee while praying for her . ` we discussed our beliefs but i certainly did n't tell her that my way was the only way . i do n't even believe it 's possible to force someone to convert . ` but the way it was all handled left me looking like a religious nutcase and i would like an acknowledgement that there is a negative attitude towards christianity in some areas of the public sector . ' the latest legal bid , she argues , will have implications for the right to express religious beliefs in the workplace . miss wasteney will be represented in court by human rights barrister paul diamond , and her appeal is supported by the christian legal centre , according to the sunday times . chief executive of the centre andrea williams told the paper : ` persecution starts with marginalisation . ` where countries let go of a cohesive christian world view you get chaos and marginalisation . ` we are letting go of what has given us our freedom . ' miss wasteney was suspended for nine months at the st john howard centre , a secure psychiatric hospital in east london , after a colleague claimed she had tried to ` bully ' her into converting to christianity . she added : ` the tribunal found it was inappropriate for her to engage in prays or give her colleague a book given her senior position . ` she is just an open , friendly , kind person and had a normal relationship with a colleague and there was nothing untoward . ` we are going to the employment appeals tribunal and will be arguing that the echr enshrines the freedom to be able to speak about faith in the workplace and not be disciplined for it and have conversations with others . ` we lodged the papers on thursday . ` the nhs is increasingly dominated by a suffocating liberal agenda that chooses to bend over backwards to accommodate certain beliefs but punishes the christian . ' - june 2013 : enya nawaz makes a formal complaint about victoria wasteney after she prayed for her and invited her to attend church events . miss wasteney is suspended for nine months pending an investigation . - 2014 : miss wasteney receives a written warning for misconduct , after a disciplinary investigation upholds three complaints . - january 2015 : miss wasteney launches an employment tribunal against the east london nhs trust , claiming they discriminated against her because of her religion . the complaint against her was upheld . - april 2015 : miss wasteney challenges the findings of the employment tribunal , saying her human rights have come ` under attack '

taxes will be # 12billion a year higher under labour than the tories , independent experts warned yesterday -- equal to # 1,052 for every working household . the institute for fiscal studies said ed miliband 's ` vague ' promise to balance the books would allow labour to borrow # 90billion more than the tories by 2020 . this would rise to # 280billion in extra debt by the end of the next decade if labour remained in power . institute for fiscal studies said ed miliband 's ` vague ' promise to balance the books would allow labour to borrow # 90billion more than the tories by 2020 and this would rise to # 280b in extra debt by the next decade . david cameron said the assessment showed labour was ' a risk to our recovery , a risk to our economy , a risk to jobs ' the think-tank warned that labour 's failure to control borrowing would leave britain ` less well placed to deal with future adverse events ' , such as another recession or the costs of an ageing population . but it was also highly critical of the lack of detail in the conservatives ' plans , saying the party had failed to spell out where it would find tens of billions of pounds in cuts . in a withering verdict , it said all the main parties were keeping voters ` in the dark ' about what they would do , adding : ` none of the parties has provided anything like full details of their fiscal plans for each year of the coming parliament . ' ifs director paul johnson said : ` all the parties have told us where they are going to increase spending on things like health , but none have said much about where the pain is going to fall . ' he said the gap between the parties ' plans was ` bigger than any time since 1992 ' -- giving voters a clear choice between more taxes , spending or borrowing . conservative plans require whitehall cuts of # 30billion , while labour could get away with savings of just # 1billion . carl emmerson , deputy director of the ifs , added : ` the electorate has a real choice , although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice . ' the ifs said labour 's plans were broadly compatible with those of its potential post-election partners in the snp . the scottish nationalists want to spend an extra # 4billion on benefits . but in an unflattering assessment , the ifs said there was a ` significant disconnect ' between its anti-austerity rhetoric and its plans . labour said the think-tank had made ` wrong assumptions ' about its plans . ed balls said : ` the ifs has confirmed that the tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party , with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years ' one in ten cancer sufferers need care at home but do not get any support , figures revealed today . it means there are around 160,000 cancer sufferers in the uk left housebound by a lack of support . the shocking statistics were released by labour as they attacked the ` crisis ' in elderly care . separate figures show three-quarters of councils are subjecting vulnerable pensioners to care visits lasting only 15 minutes . labour said it would end ` time-limited ' 15-minute visits by changing the system of paying for care by taking into consideration all of a patient 's health needs , rather than costing them separately . the party is also committed to allowing the terminally ill with the ` greatest care needs ' to have the right to die in their own homes . the cancer figures were taken from a report by macmillan cancer support which warned of sufferers left housebound , unable to wash or dress themselves -- even at risk of soiling themselves -- because of a lack of care . the daily mail has highlighted the scandal of hundreds of thousands of frail , elderly people facing ` clock-watch ' care visits with its dignity for the elderly campaign . health secretary jeremy hunt has said he is developing new commissioning standards which will discourage 15-minute visits . mr miliband has promised to balance day-to-day government spending by 2020 -- leaving labour free to continue borrowing around # 30billion a year for ` investment ' . by contrast , the conservatives want to clear the deficit in three years and start paying off britain 's # 1.5 trillion debt mountain . david cameron said the assessment showed labour was ' a risk to our recovery , a risk to our economy , a risk to jobs ' . but the ifs also raised major questions about the tories ' spending plans . it said they involved ` substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases ' , and warned they could mean ` further real cuts to unprotected departments of around # 30billion ' . tory plans for # 12billion in welfare cuts have also not been spelled out in any detail . the ifs said the lib dems deserved a ` small tick ' for being the most transparent -- although they were also criticised for failure to spell out # 12billion of planned spending cuts . chancellor george osborne said : ` saving money means taking the difficult decisions so we reduce our debt and keep our economy out of crisis and on an even keel . ' but mr balls said : ` the ifs has confirmed that the tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party , with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years . ' nick clegg said it confirmed the tories plan a ` cuts bombshell ' , adding : ` we will cut substantially less than the conservative plan to cut many public services to the bone and borrow less than the reckless plan from labour . ' all three of the main parties ' education spokesmen revealed they would have no problem with the next education secretary sending their children to private school . the bbc 's daily politics presenter andrew neil asked the trio if such a choice would be ` acceptable for an education secretary ' . labour 's tristram hunt , who was privately educated , said : ` yes . in certain circumstances . ' two of his three children go to a state primary school in north london , with the third expected to go to the same school . but he has not ruled out switching them to independent schools . privately educated schools minister david laws -- who has no children -- immediately said ` yes ' to the question . and education secretary nicky morgan , who was privately educated but sends her son to a state primary school , replied : ` yes , you do what 's right for the child . ' ukip 's jonathan arnott and the green party 's james humphreys also agreed there was no problem with a future education secretary sending their children private -- though mr arnott added it would be an ` indictment ' of the quality of state schools . only 7 per cent of children in the uk are privately educated . ukip has pledged to bring back grammar schools by converting some comprehensives , but mrs morgan said it would be a ` step backwards ' . the rare frankness about whether they would opt for a private education for their children is in stark contrast to the controversy sparked by labour left-winger diane abbott sending her son to the exclusive fee-paying city of london school . miss abbott had previously criticised harriet harman , now labour 's deputy leader , for sending her children to a selective grammar school . many politicians on the left have managed to get their children into elite state schools . both tony blair -- who converted to catholicism after standing down -- and atheist nick clegg , bagged places at leading london oratory for their children . both men are married to catholics .

new satellite images have revealed that china has constructed an airstrip on a stretch of disputed territory in the south china sea - and could be planning to build another . they reveal the country 's rapid progress in constructing the runway on the contested fiery cross reef which the philippines , vietnam , malaysia , brunei and taiwan all claim . china 's building activity in the spratly islands has infuriated neighbouring countries and the united states whose leadership accused the country of bullying others with its ` military muscle ' . images reveal fiery cross reef virtually untouched by man-made structures in march 2014 but by march this year , it had been transformed into an artificial island which could be used for military operations . they follow equally disturbing photographs released earlier this month showing a flotilla of chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built island on the nearby mischief reef . construction : newly released satellite images reveal that china has built a runway -lrb- pictured -rrb- - which could be used for military operations - in a dispute region in the south china sea . disputed : china has built the airstrip -lrb- pictured -rrb- on fiery cross reef in the spratly islands without consulting the philippines , vietnam , malaysia , brunei and taiwan who all claim the region . territory : the area near the spratly islands -lrb- pictured -rrb- where china is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region . serene : satellite images from august 2014 -lrb- pictured -rrb- show fiery cross reef as a virtually untouched and beautiful natural sea-structure . controversial : whereas just seven months later in march this year , dredging ships can clearly be seen around the artificial island which has virtually destroyed the reef . the worrying photographs were revealed by security analysts jane 's defense weekly who claim building work in the nearby subu reef could create space for yet another 3,000 m airstrip . and the same report suggested china was also working to extend a runway of that length in the paracel islands further north which is seen as a vital shipping route . more than # 3.3 trillion worth of trade passes through the potentially energy-rich section of the south china sea every year . the united states ' military commander for asia has said china could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the outposts it is building in the region , which would give it the power to enforce an exclusion zone . the images showed a paved section of runway 505m by 53m on the northeastern side of the reef which china began turning into an island with extensive dredging last year . china 's ambassador to the united states has said it was ` natural ' that his country 's reclamation work would include military defence facilities . cui tiankai said there ` should be no illusion that anyone could ... repeatedly violate china 's sovereignty without consequences ' . its actions in the south china sea have been described as ` aggressive ' by senator john mccain , chairman of the u.s. senate armed services committee . show of strength : other satellite images released earlier this month showed a flotilla of chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built islands on mischief reef in the spratly islands -lrb- pictured -rrb- . force : following their release , u.s. president barack obama accused china of using its military might to reclaim the contested territory in the south china sea . he urged president obama 's administration to move more military resources into the economically important asian region - and boost cooperation with asian countries worried by china . mccain claims washington has a lot of work ahead to maintain its military advantage in the asia-pacific . he added : ` when any nation fills in 600 acres of land and builds runways and most likely is putting in other kinds of military capabilities in what is international waters , it is clearly a threat to where the world 's economy is going , has gone , and will remain for the foreseeable future . ' a u.s. state department spokesperson said the scale of china 's land reclamation and construction is fueling concerns in the region that china intends to militarise its outposts . they said : ` we do not believe that large-scale land reclamation with the intent to militarize outposts on disputed land features is consistent with the region 's desire for peace and stability . ' japan 's vice foreign minister akitaka saiki said china had a duty to address regional concerns and his korean counterpart cho tae-yong stressed the importance of stability in the south china sea for trading nations like his . china 's leadership has hit back at u.s. president barack obama who last week condemned the country for constructing an artificial island on mischief reef in another section the disputed south china sea . obama claimed beijing was ` using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions ' amid reports of controversial land reclamation efforts in the spratly islands . worrying : a u.s. state department spokesperson said the scale of china 's land reclamation in the south china sea -lrb- pictured -rrb- is fueling concerns in the region that china intends to militarise its outposts . territory : china 's foreign ministry spokesman said the country has ` indisputable rights ' to the spratly islands -lrb- pictured -rrb- and it was ` protecting its nation 's sovereignty ' ownership : china claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the south china sea . but a furious chinese leadership hit back by claiming that washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle . only hours before obama 's comments , china 's foreign ministry spokesman hua chunying added that it has ` indisputable rights ' to the spratly islands and it was ` protecting its nation 's sovereignty ' , according to the bbc . she said the construction was to serve troops protecting the area , civilian activity such as search and rescue operations , scientific research and commercial fishing . before-and-after images from the area show aircraft runways appearing from jungle , solid masses where there was once coral and man-made harbours replacing natural reefs . the country claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the south china sea . but the philippines , vietnam , malaysia , brunei and taiwan all have overlapping claims to the region . the dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals , reefs and islets in the south china sea known as the spratlys and the paracels . several south asian countries stake claim to the territory , though china tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago . beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which , they say , includes the islands in chinese history . taiwan supports its claim , and has its own airfield on the island of taiping . vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the philippines , the closest geographically , says the islands belong to them . in 1974 , chinese forces seized the paracels from vietnam , killing 70 troops . there were further clashes between the two countries in 1988 , with 60 vietnamese soldiers killed . in 2012 china and the philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a scarborough shoal . the filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call panatag . upon boarding a chinese military vessel for inspection , officials claimed they found live sharks , clams and illegal reef . later , vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in january it was claimed china would be taken to a un tribunal to challenge its stake .
