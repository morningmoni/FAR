-lrb- cnn -rrb- he 's a blue chip college basketball recruit . she 's a high school freshman with down syndrome . at first glance trey moses and ellie meredith could n't be more different . but all that changed thursday when trey asked ellie to be his prom date . trey -- a star on eastern high school 's basketball team in louisville , kentucky , who 's headed to play college ball next year at ball state -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to eastern 's prom . so why is he taking ellie instead ? `` she 's great ... she listens and she 's easy to talk to '' he said . trey made the prom-posal -lrb- yes , that 's what they are calling invites to prom these days -rrb- in the gym during ellie 's p.e. class . trina helson , a teacher at eastern , alerted the school 's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of trey and ellie on twitter that have gone viral . she was n't surpristed by trey 's actions . `` that 's the kind of person trey is , '' she said . to help make sure she said yes , trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read `` let 's party like it 's 1989 , '' a reference to the latest album by taylor swift , ellie 's favorite singer . trey also got the ok from ellie 's parents the night before via text . they were thrilled . `` you just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child , '' said darla meredith , ellie 's mom . `` you first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect . '' darla meredith said ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school , but a special program at eastern called best buddies had made things easier for her . she said best buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions . `` i guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought , '' she said , but `` this school , this year has been a relief .

'' ellie interjected .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- as goes walmart , so goes the nation ? everyone from apple ceo tim cook to the head of the ncaa slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week , warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers . but it was the opposition from walmart , the ubiquitous retailer that dots the american landscape , that perhaps resonated most deeply , providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland . walmart 's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of arkansas came after the company said in february it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage . taken together , the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals . and some prominent republicans are urging the party to take notice . former minnesota gov. tim pawlenty , who famously called on the gop to `` be the party of sam 's club , not just the country club , '' told cnn that walmart 's actions `` foreshadow where the republican party will need to move . '' `` the republican party will have to better stand for '' ideas on helping the middle class , said pawlenty , the head of the financial services roundtable , a washington lobbying group for the finance industry . the party 's leaders must be `` willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers , such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage , and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs , housing , public accommodation against gays and lesbians . '' walmart , which employs more than 50,000 people in arkansas , emerged victorious on wednesday . hours after the company 's ceo , doug mcmillon , called on republican gov. asa hutchinson to veto the bill , the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed . walmart 's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the republican party , which the company 's political action committee has tended to support . in 2004 , the walmart pac gave around $ 2 million to republicans versus less than $ 500,000 to democrats , according to data from the center for responsive politics . that gap has grown less pronounced in recent years . in 2014 , the pac spent about $ 1.3 million to support republicans and around $ 970,000 for democrats . it has been a gradual transformation for walmart . in 2011 , the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity . two years later , the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014 . retail experts say walmart 's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base , as well as a recognition of the country 's increasingly progressive views of gay equality -lrb- support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59 % , according to a recent wall street journal/nbc news poll -rrb- . `` it 's easy for someone like a chick-fil-a to take a really polarizing position , '' said dwight hill , a partner at the retail consulting firm mcmillandoolittle . `` but in the world of the largest retailer in the world , that 's very different . '' hill added : same-sex marriage , `` while divisive , it 's becoming more common place here within the u.s. , and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer . '' the backlash over the religious freedom measures in indiana and arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community 's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality . after indiana gov. mike pence , a republican , signed his state 's religious freedom bill into law , ceos of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the hoosier state . the resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions , including bill oesterle , ceo of the business-rating website angie 's list and a one-time campaign manager for former indiana gov. mitch daniels . oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in indianapolis in light of the state 's passage of the religious freedom act . nascar , scheduled to hold a race in indianapolis this summer , also spoke out against the indiana law . `` what we 're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business , '' said jason rahlan , spokesman for the human rights campaign . the debate has reached presidential politics . national republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination . likely gop presidential candidate jeb bush initially backed indiana 's religious freedom law and pence , but moderated his tone a few days later . the former florida governor said wednesday that indiana could have taken a `` better '' and `` more consensus-oriented approach . '' `` by the end of the week , indiana will be in the right place , '' bush said , a reference to pence 's promise this week to fix his state 's law in light of the widespread backlash . others in the gop field are digging in . sen. ted cruz of texas , the only officially declared republican presidential candidate , said wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law . `` i think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda , '' cruz said . meanwhile , former secretary of state hillary clinton , who previously served on walmart 's board of directors , called on hutchinson to veto the arkansas bill , saying it would `` permit unfair discrimination '' against the lgbt community . jay chesshir , ceo of the little rock regional chamber of commerce in arkansas , welcomed hutchinson 's pledge on wednesday to seek changes to his state 's bill . he said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies . `` when it comes to culture and quality of life , businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that 's its people , '' chesshir said . `` therefore , when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things , then the business community will again speak and speak loudly . ''

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups . last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event ; the group is backed by the conservative koch brothers , and supported gov. pence 's tax-slashing budget . now , pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . why would pence ignore the pleas of indiana 's chamber of commerce as well as the republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was pence 's way of shoring up his street cred . it is also the reason why republican jeb bush , pence 's fellow white house hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend pence and the law . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . backlash aside , the fact is pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him -- and arkansas gov. asa hutchinson , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped . pence : ` was i expecting this kind of backlash ? heavens no . ' for there is no way a republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous americans into single-issue voters . i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . instead it looks like it 's going to be dragged down to a replay of pat buchanan 's `` cultural war '' speech , during which he told the 1992 republican national convention : `` we stand with -lrb- george h.w. bush -rrb- against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women '' and later followed with `` there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the cold war itself . for this war is for the soul of america . '' progressives may enjoy watching pence 's temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. ted cruz of texas , who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the gop table . and even if you think neither pence nor bush nor cruz will win the nomination , someone has to . in light of that , listen to conservative former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives ' discomfort with same-sex marriage : `` it 's like asking someone who 's jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli . '' or louisiana gov. bobby jindal : `` i certainly will support ted cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . '' or wisconsin gov. scott walker , who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions . and ben carson said jail turns people gay , so there 's that . remember : pence did n't act alone . he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . in fact , according to the american civil liberties union , `` the indiana rfra -lsb- religious freedom restoration act -rsb- is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . '' who supports , denounces indiana law ? gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we 're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . former rep. barney frank of massachusetts , the first member of congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes republicans want the supreme court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the gop primary . `` we 're winning , '' he told a crowd in chicago recently while promoting his latest book . i guess if you look at where the country was on lgbt issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . that 's assuming you are part of the `` we '' who believe lgbt people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts . but as the situation in indiana has shown , `` winning '' should not be mistaken for having `` won . '' for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called `` religious freedom '' bills snaking through red-state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it 's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with republicans controlling both the house and the senate . pence , and to a lesser extent , jeb bush , may be toxic now but america has a short attention span . more importantly , they are not alone . frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , `` winning '' is going to feel very strange .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with iran in lausanne , switzerland , on thursday that limits iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . expect pushback anyway , if the recent past is any harbinger . just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , house speaker john boehner invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to preemptively blast it before congress , and 47 senators sent a letter to the iranian leadership warning them away from a deal . the debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light . it will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions . let us address some of these : . the most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in iran . that is the position of netanyahu and his acolytes in the u.s. congress . but that is not and never was the objective . if it had been , there would have been no iranian team at the negotiating table . rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the united states and its allies could respond . the new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal . it would reduce iran 's low-enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime . another dubious assumption of opponents is that the iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program . despite sharp accusations by some in the united states and its allies , iran denies having such a program , and u.s. intelligence contends that iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon . iran 's continued cooperation with international atomic energy agency inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about iran 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal . in fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the iranians . what 's more , the rhetoric of some members of congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the united states and iran -lrb- i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by congress or a future president -rrb- . this of course is not the case . the talks were between iran and the five permanent members of the u.n. security council -lrb- united states , united kingdom , france , china and russia -rrb- plus germany , dubbed the p5 +1 . while the united states has played a leading role in the effort , it negotiated the terms alongside its partners . if the agreement reached by the p5 +1 is rejected by congress , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on iran and threaten nato cohesion in other areas . another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which iran will be free to do as it pleases . again , this is not the case . some of the restrictions on iran 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years . but most importantly , the framework agreement includes iran 's ratification of the additional protocol , which allows iaea inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared . this provision will be permanent . it does not sunset . thus , going forward , if iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the u.n. security council . many in congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the senate to `` advise and consent . '' but the issue is not suited for a treaty . treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories . for example , the new start treaty limits russia and the united states to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads . but any agreement with iran will not be so balanced . the restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on iran . the p5 +1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions , which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal . finally some insist that any agreement must address iranian missile programs , human rights violations or support for hamas or hezbollah . as important as these issues are , and they must indeed be addressed , they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal : preventing a nuclear iran . to include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill . this agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies , including israel . those judgments should be fact-based , not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- standing up for what you believe . what does it cost you ? what do you gain ? memories pizza in the indiana town of walkerton is finding out . the family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state 's religious freedom restoration act after its owners said they 'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple 's wedding . `` if a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding , we 'd have to say no , '' crystal o'connor told cnn affiliate wbnd-tv in south bend . the statement struck at the heart of fears by critics , who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians . they called for boycotts . but supporters also rallied . and by the end of the week , they had donated more than $ 842,000 for the business . social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern indiana knew existed before this week . riskyliberal tweeted : `` dear #memoriespizza . no . my boycotting your business because i do n't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion . '' `` do n't threaten #memoriespizza '' tweeted aღanda . `` just mock them for their ignorance . '' bad reviews flooded the restaurant 's facebook page , most having little to do with the quality of the food . many too vulgar to share . `` do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens ? boycott memories pizza !! '' said rob katz of indianapolis . `` let 's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business . '' anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . but one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant wednesday and was expected to do the same thursday . `` who 's going to walkerton with me to burn down memories pizza ? '' jessica dooley of goshen tweeted , according to the walkerton police department . the account has been deleted since the tweet was posted . detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment , intimidation and threats , according to charles kulp , assistant police chief . the mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of walkerton . a man stood outside memories simply holding a sign that reads `` bigots . '' jason narducy bought $ 100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out , wbnd reported . `` do you want some non-discriminatory pizza ? '' narducy asked . but for every tweet and facebook post taking memories pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support . `` because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill christians & burn down their businesses , '' said a tweet from victor nikki . `` what 's happening to #memoriespizza is n't the free market , it 's a lynch mob , '' tweeted savannah . `` cyber bulling is n't the same as taking your business elsewhere . '' supporters rallied to a gofundme page in support of memories pizza . by the time the fundraiser ended late friday , $ 842,387 had been raised . the purpose of the campaign is `` to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors ' stand for faith , '' according to lawrence billy jones ii , the man who started it . for the o'connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream . it was n't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs , they told wbnd . `` that 's a lifestyle that you choose . i choose to be heterosexual . they choose to be homosexual , '' kevin o'connor told the tv station . `` you ca n't beat me over the head with something they choose to be . '' faced with threats against business , they 're still weighing the cost . cnn 's rob frehse and melanie whitley contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , youtube channels , even social media platforms like facebook and twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media . it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating . it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online . it is not unique to asia , but it might seem more pronounced if you live there . going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard . but it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly . let 's look at the legal angle first . amos yee , the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail sunday in singapore , drew international attention for his anti-lee kuan yew harangue . but jailing critics is not usually the government 's first choice in singapore . it is part of lee kuan yew 's legacy that the government 's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices . his father has reportedly apologized for his son 's behavior , but the younger yee could face up to three years in jail . yee is not unique . another dissident blogger in singapore , roy ngerng , continues to suffer financial and legal pressure , including the loss of his job , because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state 's prime minister , lee hsien loong , of corruption . ngerng 's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the central provident fund , the government 's compulsory pension program . yee and ngerng are two of many . the committee to protect journalists ' file on singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases , some against politicians , others against citizens simply frustrated with their government . but it is not just singapore where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in malaysia , with much less of the international attention heaped on amos yee , five editors and executives from the malaysian insider were arrested over the site 's march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the conference of rulers , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under islamic law . in deeply muslim malaysia , questions of islamic faith are a third-rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced . by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is china , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them uighur or tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism . but in second place in asia is vietnam , where cpj 's most recent prison census showed vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of december 1 . add one more in late december , nguyen dinh ngoc , a prominent blogger who was arrested for `` law-violating '' after police searched his home in southern ho chi minh city on december 27 , and two more in january , nguyen quang lap and hong le tho , arrested on anti-state charges of `` abusing democratic freedoms '' and you can see the pattern . because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in vietnam . only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in vietnam , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013 . both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage . the list could go on , but the reality is that , as cpj wrote in 2013 , across asia `` governments have curtailed internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices , including prohibitive laws , heightened surveillance and censorship , and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses . '' that is still the policy path being followed by most countries in asia , and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon . jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another . since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online . because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the internet , that proportion can be expected to grow . while most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers , bangladesh has recently become the exception . on monday , washiqur rahman babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in bangladesh in the past five weeks . blogger avijit roy and his wife , rafida ahmed bonna , were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting dhaka . roy , a u.s. citizen of bangladeshi origin , was killed and his wife was critically injured . both rahman and roy had written critically on islamic matters . the blogger death toll gets higher in bangladesh if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity . in january 2013 , blogger asif mohiuddin , who wrote critical commentary on religion , islamist groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by islamists . in february 2013 , blogger ahmed rajib haider , who had written about islamic fundamentalism and islamist groups , was hacked to death by members of an islamist militant group , according to police investigations . later in 2013 , islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy . while arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions . the bottom line : online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors . where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom . where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .

atlanta -lrb- cnn -rrb- it was a scene worthy of any top cop show on tv -- bullets flying , banged-up cars and the fbi chasing an armed robbery suspect . in the end , two agents were injured in a crash and the suspect was shot before being captured . fbi agents and task force officers were following 36-year-old kevone charleston of austell , georgia , as he pulled into a cvs pharmacy in forsyth county , georgia , early saturday . charleston is suspected of involvement in 32 commercial robberies dating to november 2013 , according to fbi officials . `` the incident all happened around 7 o'clock saturday morning , '' said fbi special agent stephen emmett . `` there were multiple agents and officers that were following him based on his prior mo , and when they saw he was about to rob another cvs , they moved in . '' authorities say charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong . then he walked to the cvs , preparing to enter . when agents confronted him , charleston ran , got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire . `` there were several fbi vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect 's vehicle when he was trying to flee . one government vehicle sustained heavy damage to its front and side , and another government suv ended up on its side . that 's how the two agents sustained their injuries , '' emmett said . twelve fbi agents and six government vehicles followed charleston . emmett said charleston `` was trying to get away , our agents were trying to stop him . he collided with the first government vehicle , the taurus , then the second , and the suv ended on its side . `` the perp was stopped 8 feet away in the median , and that 's where he received his gunshot wounds . '' the two agents were treated at an area hospital and released , according to emmett , who says `` they are fine . '' charleston was shot and wounded by fbi agents and task force officers , but his injuries are not life threatening , according to forsyth county sheriff 's deputy robin regan . although he declined to give details of the 32 previous robberies , emmett said it was an intensive investigation that was already underway as a priority for the fbi 's violent crimes and major offender squad . he added , `` his mo involved armed confrontations , so our officers went into this fully prepared for an armed confrontation based on his past history . '' emmett says he 's relieved that the fbi 's officers and agents are ok and that the suspect is in custody . he said it was the `` conclusion of an intensive and lengthy investigation . '' cnn 's vivian kuo and ryan scallan contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being , according to her attorney , josh michtom . a connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision wednesday denying a motion to let the teen , identified in court documents as `` cassandra c. , '' go home . the judge also denied a motion for visitation . the 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments . on march 16 , michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother 's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness . michtom and attorney michael taylor , who represents cassandra 's mother , jackie fortin , released a written statement after receiving the judge 's decision wednesday : `` we are disappointed in this ruling , not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence . we 're conferring with our clients now about next steps , including whether to take another appeal . '' cassandra was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma in september and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy . without it , doctors said at the time , she was likely to die within two years . she started chemotherapy in november but ran away after two days , according to court documents , when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body . in december , a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the connecticut department of children and families . at that time , she was admitted to connecticut children 's medical center in hartford and has remained there since then . doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them . cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned , according to michtom . `` she 's seen in her case the side effects were n't bad , and she 's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment , '' he said . her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month . michtom and taylor failed in their effort before the connecticut supreme court to make the case that cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions . joette katz , the commissioner of the department of children and families , told cnn in march the agency is `` very pleased with cassandra 's progress toward a complete recovery . we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life . '' the agency has denied cnn 's request to speak with cassandra or her physicians . according to michtom , the department of children and families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but has n't . he said the department sees cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before . representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with michtom and taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of april -- and that she 'll be allowed to return home . so for now , cassandra is said to spend her days reading , watching tv and drawing . `` the hospital is effectively jail , '' michtom said .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- when hong kong police answered a call in the early hours of a saturday morning last november , they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city . one woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks . another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony . a former banker , 29-year-old briton rurik jutting , was charged with two counts of murder . on thursday , a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until may . here 's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker . jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene , an upmarket apartment in the middle of wan chai , an inner-city suburb that 's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars , residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods . in the early hours of saturday morning , november 1 , police say jutting called them to the apartment . there they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor , later identified as 29-year-old seneng mujiasih . during a search of the apartment , officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony . it 's alleged 25-year-old sumarti ningsih was killed on october 27 , five days before her body was found . sumarti ningsih was from cilacap , in central java , and was the mother of a five-year-old girl . in a statement , her cousin , jumiati , described her as `` just an ordinary woman from indonesia '' who , like many others , was `` forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes -lrb- sic -rrb- true . '' `` she wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family , '' jumiati wrote . `` she is good girl and did not deserve this treatment . '' according to the asian migrant coordinating body , ningsih was visiting hong kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to jakarta the day after her body was found . last year , her grieving father , ahmad khaliman , told agence france-presse that his daughter had worked in hong kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013 . she 'd since returned on two occasions , khaliman said . he said the family had been shocked by her murder , and called for the perpetrator to be executed . `` if not , i can not accept it . he has already taken my daughter 's life , so he has to pay with his life , '' he told cnn affiliate trans7 . seneng mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in hong kong but had overstayed her visa , according to the asian migrant co-ordinating body . also known as jesse lorena , mujiasih was from the city of muna in sulawesi province , in southeast indonesia . other than that , few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in hong kong . after news of their death spread , fellow domestic workers held a vigil in hong kong 's victoria park . around 200 people gathered to sing and pray , and lay flowers besides photos of the two women . the victims ' bodies were buried after being repatriated to indonesia in november . before being taken into custody , rurik jutting lived in the upmarket j residence in wan chai . he was detained at the scene , where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises . it 's unclear when jutting left his job as a trader at the bank of america merrill lynch ; a boa spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past . jutting 's profile on linkedin said he haad been employed at the bank 's structured equity finance and trading division in hong kong since july 2013 . before that , he worked in the same unit in london for three years . according to the profile , jutting previously worked in capital markets for the british bank barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious university of cambridge , between 2004 and 2008 . as part of the trial process , tests were conducted to determined if jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea . he was . the case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and dna evidence to be analyzed .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- marco rubio is all in . the republican senator from florida has announced that he is seeking the republican presidential nomination , running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the american dream . with his youthful energy and hispanic roots , it 's tempting to see rubio as the new blood that the gop needs in order to compete against hillary clinton in 2016 . yet rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues : immigration reform and cuba relations . he holds little appeal to latino voters . and unless he can offer new ideas , his climb to the republican nomination will be steep . back in 2013 , rubio was a member of the senate `` gang of 8 '' that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform , including a path to citizenship for the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants . he later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from house republicans , and now says he favors a piecemeal approach , starting with securing the border . his retreat on immigration means that rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive republican presidential candidates . that 's a shame , for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to latino voters . instead , rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration . he believes that president obama 's deferred action program , offering deportation relief to young immigrants , should be ended . he has stated that the president 's executive action on immigration , on hold pending a circuit court review , sets a `` horrifying precedent . '' meanwhile , both the deferred action program and president obama 's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by hispanics . no wonder the research firm latino decisions reports that , `` we find no evidence that rubio 's candidacy will draw significant latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally . '' so , if rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow hispanics , he is mistaken . at a private breakfast monday for supporters , rubio described running against `` one candidate in the race who 's from yesterday , and one who wants to take us back to yesterday . '' but when it comes to cuba policy , rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past . over the weekend , he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous . he has warned that cuba is taking advantage of the united states . here , he is an increasingly lonely voice . most americans support better relations with cuba , as do a majority of cuban-americans . by clinging to the notion that isolating cuba is better than engaging with the communist country , rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership . immigration and cuba policy aside , rubio 's political philosophy will be a tough sell to hispanics . he is a fierce opponent of `` obamacare '' and wants the law repealed . however , the affordable care act has led to a 12.3 % drop in the hispanic uninsured rate , making latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance , thanks to the law . -lrb- in fact , rubio signed his own family up for `` obamacare '' on the washington exchange , taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers . -rrb- . rubio favors smaller government , while latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less . and though rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the new york times has noted that latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue . sure , rubio is young and charismatic . but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate . in february , he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website politico . another rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals . consider that his fellow contender for the gop presidential nomination , sen. rand paul of kentucky , has been willing to present new ideas to the republican base , such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana . or that another gop candidate for president , sen. ted cruz of texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand . by comparison , rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing republican voters . with his early leap into the 2016 race , marco rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of gop leadership . unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for rubio , and not for latino voters .

barcelona took a major step towards qualification for the last four of the champions league after they dismantled paris saint-germain on wednesday night . sportsmail 's adam crafton takes a look at five things we learned from barcelona 's emphatic victory . super suarez . it feels rather strange now but there was a time last summer when we were all wondering whether luis suarez - with his penchant for a human-based snack during football matches - was worth all that money for barcelona . there can be no question anymore . it is now 17 goals for the season and barcelona 's front three , spearheaded by suarez , lionel messi and neymar is the most in-form in world football . they are a frightening prospect and suarez , after three goals in his first 12 games for barcelona , has hit the high notes at the right time . he has scored 10 in his last 11 games - including two crucial goals away at manchester city - and his understanding with his strike partners has elevated this barcelona side to a new level . luis suarez scores his second of the night to give barcelona a 3-0 lead in their tie at paris saint-germain . the former liverpool forward is mobbed by his barcelona team-mates after doubling his tally for the evening . psg yearn for zlatan 's quality . prior to this game , psg were unbeaten so far this season when playing without zlatan ibrahimovic , winning 11 and drawing 5 of the 16 games . it had developed a view - nourished by that inspiring performance when ibrahbimovic was sent off at chelsea - that psg may be a stronger collective unit without the swede . yet on the grandest occasions , you still require that moment of world-class quality and laurent blanc really needed edinson cavani to stand tall here . zlatan ibrahimovic , pictured in action on saturday , missed the game against barcelona through suspension . edinson cavani failed to deliver the goods for psg and looked out-of-sorts against barcelona on wednesday . once more , though , the uruguayan failed to deliver on the biggest stage . psg fans still wince at the memory of his miss against chelsea at stamford bridge last season and so often , he leaves you wanting more in these pivotal games . he was brilliantly denied by a javier mascherano challenge in the first half but you sensed he lacked the conviction to really make the most of the opportunity . he does some wonderful things , moving with pace and intelligence but when faced with a guilt-edged opening , he too often loses that defining ability to remain cool and detached when faced by a goalkeeper and the roar of the crowd . when bearing down on mascherano in the first half , he was like a pianist whose timing has deserted him , hesitating and pontificating . it is now only four goals in 15 games and you can perhaps understand why psg may be tempted to cash in on him . neymar back in form . after a run of three goals in 10 games , the brazilian had begun to fade into the shadows a little , particularly when placed against the the brilliance of lionel messi and luis suarez . the local rumour mill had begun swirling and there were suggestions - not without foundation - in the catalan media that neymar is unhappy with how often he is substituted by his manager . this was a good response . he remains such a talent and the opening goal tonight was clinically dispatched and marked his 28th goal of an excellent season . messi was pulling the strings as ever but neymar was the most eye-catching barcelona forward in the first-half . neymar was barcelona 's most eye-catching forward in the first half of their victory against psg . neymar celebrates with luis suarez after the uruguayan scored his first of two goals against psg . psg 's euro home run comes to an end . this victory for barcelona brought a shuddering end to psg 's proud unbeaten run at the parc de princes in european competition . barcelona are the first team to win here in either the europa league or champions league since hapoel tel-aviv in 2006 - an undefeated streak that had lasted nine years , yielding 22 wins and 11 draws . in truth , the victory was rarely in doubt from the first whistle , such was barcelona 's composure and quality on the ball . sir alex ferguson once described the experience of facing barcelona 's passing game as like being on a ` carousel ' . psg started brightly and for a few moments , it looked like the carousel might have malfunctioned . but it was no more than a glitch . psg hopped on and when the referee finally called time , they staggered off across the fairground , most probably feeling rather sick . marquinhos and yohan cabaye reflect on psg 's defeat ... their first at home in european football since 2006 . busquets is the midfield maestro . we have marvelled for years at the gifts of xavi and andres iniesta and while the shielding work of sergio busquets has also been appreciated , it does seem as though he has become even more prominent under luis enrique . he reads the game with such intelligence , stepping in with poise and composure to mop up the danger . those around him - iniesta , rakitic and xavi add the decoration - but busquets ' consistent brilliance forms the foundations of this barcelona midfield . every team is grateful to its ` water-carriers ' , as eric cantona once dubbed didier deschamps , but with busquets in this form , barcelona could be heading towards the champagne come the end of the season . sergio busquets ' consistent brilliance forms the foundations of the barcelona midfield .

tom varndell helped himself to a hat-trick against london welsh as wasps won away from home in the aviva premiership for the first time in 2015 to keep their top-six hopes alive . ahead of the trip to the kassam stadium , wasps ' hunt for an automatic european rugby champions cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions . however , they claimed a 40-13 win over welsh with tries from varndell , ashley johnson , sailosi tagicakibau and alapati leiua . tom varndell crosses for one of his three tries as wasps ran out comfortable winners at the kassam stadium . it was far from plain sailing for wasps , though as the exiles , whose defeat to bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table , trailed 12-5 at half-time after opeti fonua bundled over after the first two of varndell 's tries . but johnson dotted down and varndell added his third before tagicakibau secured the bonus point for wasps , with alapati leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game . chris elder scored welsh 's second try of the match in the second period . wasps got off to a fast start at the kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes . the visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner , veteran fly-half andy goode converting well from a tight angle . welsh then went down to 14 men eight minutes later when koree britton was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul and wasps instantly capitalised as varndell grabbed his second try . seb stegmann is tackled by carlo festuccia as the exiles put up a fight , but faded away again . alapati leiua breaks away to score a late try as wasps pulled away in the closing stages . the exiles crept back into the game , though , keeping the pressure on wasps ' defence and fonua forced his way through to make it 12-5 , tristan roberts kicking the conversion side . welsh started the second half well and roberts made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further . but wasps soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try-line was bundled over by johnson in his first start as hooker . then a swift break down the right saw varndell free to run back around the welsh defence and score under the posts for his hat-trick . elder scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the exiles on his aviva premiership debut , as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner . wasps instantly replied though as tagicakibau finished a great run through the centre by reaching for the line . and the game ended on a high for wasps as leiua finished the scoring with a darting run through the middle . james cannon wins a line-out for wasps ahead of london welsh 's matt corker as wasps recovered their form . andy goode adds extras as wasps renewed their chase for a european champions cup place .

most women have known the frustrated feeling of nursing the broken heel of a irreplaceable shoe . or perhaps even experienced the struggle of finding footwear that is appropriate for all occasions . tanya heath paris has revolutionised women 's footwear with her collection of shoes that feature an interchangeable heel . scroll down for video . tanya heath paris features hundreds of heel varieties that slide and click into place , and can be released at the push of a button . a high heel -lrb- up to 3.5 inches -rrb- can be swapped for a lower heel -lrb- 1.5 inches -rrb- , without compromising the style . the first of their kind , the shoes , which start from # 260 -rrb- are supposedly comfortable and come in a variety of styles . every shoe features a button on the inside of the shoe , in the centre of the heel . once a new heel is slid into the shoe , it is locked into place , and at the press of the button , the heel can be released and slid out of place . the fact that the heel unlocks also makes awkward packing attempts a lot easier , and means that the heels can be also be slipped into an evening bag . in terms of storing the shoes , the heel can easily be slid off and packed away , which makes for less clumsy carrying or packing . there are hundreds of heel varieties available , from high to low , stiletto to chunky , and in a large array of prints . the brand was perfected in september 2013 , with the tagline reading : ` same shoe , different heels , endless possibilities . ' from strappy metallic sandals , to versatile black pumps , there are styles to fit all occasions , and that 's before the multitude of heel choices are taken into consideration . canadian-born designer tanya heath has lived and worked in paris for the last 20 years . the interchangeable heels come in all widths , from chunky and secure , to a stylish stiletto , and prints vary from leopard print , to pink glitter , to even adorned with metal spikes . undoubtedly , the real sell is that , without changing the form or composition of the actual shoe , a high heel -lrb- up to 3.5 inches -rrb- can be swapped in for a low heel -lrb- 1.5 inches -rrb- . masterminding the brand is canadian fashion designer , tanya heath . the 44-year-old has lived and worked in paris for the last 20 years , and worked in strategy , consulting , technology and private equity . also a wife and a mum of three , heath had no prior professional training and was completely self-taught . when tanya talks about inspiration for the start of the brand , she insists that it was completely personal . ' -lsb- the inspiration was -rsb- from my life . i wore high heels to work , to restaurants , to parties . ' i wore them everywhere but i could never manage the pain . once i nearly had a car accident when my heel locked under the break . ' i just fantasised non-stop about a shoe where you could just take the heels off , and that would go from a comfortable low-heel to a high-heel , and still make me look good ! ' tanya has admitted that it was difficult to create a shoe , where the composition would n't change depending on the height of the heel . ` it took 14 engineers and two and a half years to perfect the arch and the clip . ` once we had a working principle , over 10 designers , shoe technicians and last specialists worked on creating styles that work in multi-height . ' her shoe collection has now become fully integrated with her own wardrobe . she has worn a style from the collection ` every day of my life for the past 3 years ! ' tanya heath 's invention means that high stilettos -lrb- pictured left -rrb- can be swapped for a chunky more comfortable heel -lrb- pictured right -rrb- depending on the occasion . it 's not only just the heel height that 's the selling point - different prints can boost the outfit . in this case , pink sparkly heels are being chosen and slid on . in terms of the celebrities tanya would want to wear the heels , the list is endless . ` there are so many women who i admire . i would love kate middleton to try a pair because she has single-handedly re-branded fashion for the monarchy . ` and also emma thompson , who was so clearly unhappy with the comfort of her heels last year at the academy awards . '

a devastated couple has launched a desperate search for their beloved pet cat after he disappeared following a 14-hour flight from abu dhabi to new york . felix the cat has been missing for almost a week after he escaped from his crate at john f kennedy international airport . the two-year-old grey tabby belongs to jennifer stewart , 31 , and her 34-year-old husband , joseph naaman , who said the airline-approved pet carrier was damaged so badly -- apparently while being transferred from the plane -- that felix was able to get out and run away . jennifer stewart and husband , joseph naaman , pictured with their cat , felix , who disappeared april 1 . jennifer told mailonline travel that she is n't satisfied with the way felix 's crate was secured and transported on the etihad airways flight . she said his crate was tied down to a large metal pallet and cracked open , apparently when one of the straps got caught on something as it was being moved to a cargo bay after the april 1 flight . she said : ` to find out how he was transported , i was horrified , i was sick . they basically strapped him in like he was an old box . ` if i had known he was going to travel like that we would have looked for other alternatives . ` he is a part of our family . he 's like a dog . he plays fetch and hide and seek , and he 's the coolest little cat . ' the couple was told that the plastic crate broke open after one of the ropes became tangled on something . felix 's plastic pet carrier was tied down to a metal pallet while he was transported on the plane . jennifer said she is n't sure which company was responsible for transferring felix from the plane , but a cargo manager called her and her husband into an office after they landed to deliver the bad news . ` we were in shock that this happened . at first i thought he was going to tell me that -lsb- felix -rsb- died . ` he told me his cage was crushed . ' while in abu dhabi she spent weeks researching the best way to transport felix and she initially booked a ticket with a different airline , but there was a problem with the reservation and she was forced to switch to their flight and felix 's to etihad airways . felix the cat disappeared after his crate was damaged after a flight from abu dhabi to new york . owner jennifer stewart said she spent weeks researching the best way to transport felix to the us . jennifer , a yoga instructor , and joseph , a strategy consultant , couple spent $ 1,200 -lrb- # 800 -rrb- to bring felix to the us with them after living in the united arab emirates for three years . they adopted him seven months ago after they found him wandering on the street in their abu dhabi neighbourhood , and they never gave any thought to leaving him behind . the couple has n't given up hope that felix will be found , and has sought help from a non-profit organisation , where is jack ? , which provided a dog that is trained to track down animals based on their scent . jennifer and joseph have n't given up hope and plan to return to the airport to search for felix . the couple adopted the two-year-old cat seven months ago after he was abandoned in their neighbourhood . they searched the airport on saturday , but were unable to access secure areas , and plan to return tomorrow morning to look for felix again . an etihad airways spokesperson told mailonline travel that it is investigating felix 's disappearance and continues to search for the cat . the spokesperson said : ` we are working with the ground handlers and other third-party specialists , paid for by etihad airways , to locate the cat . ` we deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search . jennifer and joseph have enlisted the help of a non-profit organisation to locate the cat at jfk airport . etihad airways said it is working with ground handlers and ` third-party specialists ' to find the cat . ` we will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident , as the safety and care of pets travelling with etihad airways is a top priority . ' etihad cargo carries more than 200 animals each year and it is ` extremely rare ' for one to escape , the spokesperson added . mailonline travel has contacted the port authority of new york and new jersey , which oversees the airport , for comment .

' this lady , named sam , was painted to look like tree bark , although it is unclear as to why she is carrying a gun . todd -lrb- left -rrb- wanted to be painted into the las vegas sign , whilst kelc and becca -lrb- right -rrb- were painted as a wall . erin looks relaxed as she poses having been painted by natalie as a field of flowers . but natalie says that the models that she has been working with have kept her going even when times have got tough . she revealed : ` but what keeps me going ? my models ! they 're so brave ! some have modeled in 45 degree weather , some have de-robed withing 30 mins of meeting me . ` some have had to walk through national monuments in their undies painted up . i have a love for humanity more than i ever have ! benji is painted as a fence , natalie says that she asks her subjects to email with suggestions of what they would like to be painted as .

' but a spokesman for chapman denied the marriage was in trouble and said they had spent the weekend together . max dundas , a long term representative for chapman , told mailonline : ` this story is absolutely nonsense . i spoke to georgina yesterday , they have spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever . ' in the meantime , weinstein is waiting to see if the manhattan district attorney will decide to seek charges before making his next move , according to the source . out and about : harvey weinstein is pictured leaving his new york townhouse on thursday , nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model . he voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . accusations : italian model ambra battilana , 22 , told police that the hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a ` business meeting ' at his tribeca office in manhattan on friday night . max dundas , a long term representative for chapman , told mailonline : ` i spoke to georgina this week , they spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever . ' a spokesman for weinstein also told the daily news that the idea the allegations were causing a strain on the couple 's relationship was ` patently untrue ' and that ` whomever is saying it , is lying ' . on saturday the couple were pictured at their connecticut home . weinsten was spotted outside the home . chapman was seen rolling up to the compound in a silver mercedes-benz before she went inside . while he has denied the incident occurred , the source dismissed claims that the model had planned the encounter in an effort to land a movie role . as weinstein fights to throw out the allegations , the new york daily news reports that police overheard a phone call between battilana and weinstein , in which she confronted him - and he said : ` it wo n't happen again ' . according to a daily news ' source , weinstein appeared to confirm he groped battilana during a phone call with the italian national . ` she said something to the effect that she was uncomfortable with him doing that , ' the source told the daily news . ` and he said something to the effect , ` it wo n't happen again . '' ` he did n't deny doing what she said he did to her . the content of the phone call , there 's no question about what he did . ' battilana has claimed weinstein asked her for a kiss and groped her during a ` business meeting ' at his tribeca office in manhattan on friday night . dailymail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment . battilana also convinced weinstein to meet him a restaurant and the nypd were also there to watch that meeting , according to the newspaper . it is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the tribeca grand hotel , weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on saturday . model : battilana -lrb- pictured -rrb- claims he assaulted her at his office on friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on thursday night . afterwards , she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . beauty queen : battilana is pictured left during the miss italia contest in rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . he requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe . battilana 's attorney , david godosky , said tuesday is the earliest he expects to hear a decision on whether weinstein will face criminal charges , according to the new york daily news . a legal expect told the daily news that , if the da decides to prosecute weinstein , he will likely only face misdemeanor charges . the alleged incident unfolded at weinstein 's tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on friday night , hours after meeting her at radio city music hall on thursday night . when she arrived at the office , the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt , she told police . he also asked her for a kiss , she claimed . she clearly rejected him and he backed off , the new york daily news reported , and she fled from the building . security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving , the newspaper reported . under surveillance : following the alleged incident , she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the tribeca grand hotel -lrb- pictured -rrb- and the meeting was monitored by police , according to reports . the model 's lawyer said his client was ` creeped out ' by her alleged encounter with weinstein , who is behind hit movies including pulp fiction , the king 's speech and gangs of new york . ` when she was describing what happened , her face became contorted , ' said mark heller . ` it was that look of someone who was creeped out . she 's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that . ' weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible . no charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared . ` we are confident that we will be fully vindicated , ' a weinstein spokesman said . a source close to the weinstein company told page six the groping allegations were nothing more than a ` blackmail attempt ' and insisted that the award-winning producer ` did nothing wrong ' . weinstein 's camp have dismissed miss battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past . it has emerged that battilana previously told italian authorities she witnessed a so-called ` bunga-bunga ' orgy involving disgraced italian prime minister silvio berlusconi at his milan mansion in 2010 . she claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the italian leader during a raunchy dinner party . weinstein has been married to his second wife , 38-year-old fashion designer georgina chapman , since 2007 . the couple have two young children together . it also emerged that she told italian police in 2010 that she was ` forced against ' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old ` businessman of substantial means ' when she was underage . battilana met the wealthy car dealer in september 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in italy , according to italian newspaper reports . in her police statement , she said the man invited her into his car , where he then caressed ` my hand and left leg ' and proposed ` that i become his ` playmate ' , she said . battilana said he then gave her a bag with $ 2,000 , before assuring her it was only ` an advance of the $ 5,000 he would give me every month ' . she added : ` despite the indecency of the proposal , both because of my psychological subjection in which i found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family i felt forced against my will not to refuse the money . ' the relationship ended after she was accepted into the miss italia 2010 pageant . prosecutors in italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out . in 2012 , the alba prosecutor told italian newspaper corriere della sera that miss battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims . the alleged groping took place on march 27 at the weinstein company offices in manhattan -lrb- pictured -rrb- where battilana had met harvey weinstein to ` discuss business ' after becoming famous through the miss italia pageant , battilana began modeling professionally in 2011 , according to social media . she works internationally in milan , london , paris and new york . she recently shot an editorial campaign for bambi magazine in agent provocateur lingerie . weinstein , who is originally from queens , new york , founded miramax studio with his brother bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $ 200 million . he is married to british-born fashion designer chapman , 38 , who founded the luxury label marchesa . the couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter . weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant , eve chilton , which ended in 2004 .

nicola sturgeon has said she would work with ed miliband 's left-wing backbenchers to ensure a labour minority government did not pursue austerity . the snp leader also pledged to form alliances with minor parties such as the greens and plaid cymru to ensure mr miliband did not impose any more cuts . ' i do n't think the country can afford more austerity , ' she told itv 's the agenda . ' i would be seeking to build alliances with parties like plaid cymru and the greens and backbenchers . i could never ever support a tory government . ' nicola sturgeon has said she would work with ed miliband 's left-wing backbenchers to ensure a labour minority government did not pursue austerity . miss sturgeon said she would make a decision on an issue-by-issue basis , forcing a labour minority government to seek snp support for every single bill . the comments came after a scottish poll delivered another blow to mr miliband 's hopes of achieving an overall majority . the shock survey found that 52 per cent of voters north of the border supported nicola sturgeon 's nationalists -- more than double labour 's support at just 24 per cent . it means mr miliband could not hope to move into number 10 without the snp 's say-so . asked if never she could never vote down a labour government , miss sturgeonresponded : ` minority government is all about building alliances on an issue by issue basis . ` it 's about where can i find support across this parliament for the position i want to build upon . ' ms sturgeon also pledged to form alliances with minor parties such as the greens and plaid cymru . she confirmed she would like to see some sort of pact between labour and the snp ; although she would not want a coalition . ` minority government can be stable and effective and successful , and we know how can contribute to making a minority government work , ' she said . ` we have a vested interest as long as we are part of the westminster system to make sure it works as well as possible . ` what i am trying to say is look , here is a hand of friendship and not be secretive about my support for independence . ' miss sturgeon insisted a vote for the snp did not mean a vote for a second referendum . she said : ` as the leader of the snp i am saying very clearly to people that voting snp in this election is not voting for another independence referendum . ` for there to be another ref people would have to vote for a party that had that as a proposal in a manifesto in a scottish parliament election . ` for the snp to put it into another manifesto there has to be a change of circumstances from last year . ' the tns poll , which showed the liberal democrats on 6 per cent and 13 per cent siding with the tories , would see labour losing dozens of seats in scotland . this would make it almost impossible for him to get an overall majority in westminster ; increasing the chances of him having to reach a deal with the snp to win power . the poll 's 28-point lead is nearly double last month 's figure , when the snp and labour scored 46 per cent and 30 per cent respectively . the scottish nationalists ' surge in the polls comes amid signs of a split between labour leadership in london and jim murphy , the labour leader in scotland . mr murphy has suggested that the party would not need to make ` further cuts to achieve our spending rules ' in the next parliament . first minister and snp leader nicola sturgeon receives flowers while on the general election campaign trail at new lanark world heritage site , lanarkshire . the scottish first minister said the snp would never form an alliance with the conservative party but could support labour . but yesterday chuka umunna , labour 's business spokesman , slapped him down ; telling the bbc 's daily politics programme that cuts would have to be made throughout the life of the new parliament . ` the leader of the scottish labour party will not be in charge of the uk budget , ' she said . ` the leader of our country , our next prime minister , ed miliband , will be in charge of the uk budget . and he was absolutely clear : there will be the need for further consolidation and cuts throughout the rest of the parliament . ' and , speaking to the bbc radio 4 today programme , shadow chancellor ed balls said : ` i ca n't say to scotland that you 're going to be exempt from spending cuts in the unprotected areas but they 're sensible . ' labour party leader ed miliband speaks at train engineering company in loughborough today , with just over three weeks until polling day . mr miliband has insisted that he is not concerned about the polls in scotland and claimed people were still making up their minds . when asked at his manifesto launch in manchester the state of the polls in scotland , mr miliband said : ` there is a really important argument now about what the snp commitments are . ` let 's see what happens on may 7 in relation to scotland , because i think there are many , many people still making up their minds . ' scottish labour leader jim murphy said : ` the choice at this election could n't be clearer - investment in the future of young scots and an end to austerity with scottish labour , or losing # 1,400 per person for our schools and hospitals with nicola sturgeon 's plans for full fiscal autonomy .

fleece jackets , piles of hay , a fuzzy stuffed animal sloth and a lot of fruit were on bobbi gordon 's shopping list when she became a surrogate mother to a big-eyed , spikey-haired little boy . a handful of animal keepers at salt lake city 's hogle zoo found themselves with a tiny red-headed charge when eve , a bornean orangutan , died a few weeks after giving birth . now 5 months old , the 14-inch , 11-pound tuah is starting to crawl . scroll down for video . a new addition : tuah , the five month-old bornean orangutan looks on in the great ape building at utah 's hogle zoo on friday . tuah was revealed to the public on saturday , with visitors -- some of whom wore ' i met tuah ' buttons -- lining up around the ape building to catch their first glimpse . about 9,000 people visited the zoo saturday , said erica hansen , the zoo 's community relations coordinator . ` it was such a larger day -lrb- for attendance -rrb- than we usually have in april , ' she said . gordon is one of several primate handlers who provided round-the-clock care for the infant , improvising along the way . ` we lived like an orangutan , ' gordon said . ` it was exhausting . ' orphan : tuah 's parents eve and elijah , both passed away last fall just a few weeks after tuah 's birth . orangutans spend most of their time in trees . a baby orangutan instinctively clings to his mother 's fur while she builds nests and scavenges for food . so tuah could n't be swaddled and put in a crib like a human baby ; he needed to hang onto someone , even while sleeping . a zoo employee used specialized sewing machines and old fleece jackets to make a vest with strips that simulate an orangutan 's fur . the animal keepers took turns wearing the vest and crawling in hay , while tuah held tight to their chests , developing his muscle strength . but tuah ca n't cling to humans forever . that 's where his sister , acara , comes in . after tuah 's birth , zookeepers began training acara on maternal duties . acara will turn 10 next month and is an eager-to-please orangutan that enjoys learning , gordon said . ` gorillas are a whole other different story , but orangutans are very easy , ' said gordon with a laugh . she called the species ` insanely intelligent . ' taken care of : after four months of round-the-clock care from zookeepers and his older sister , an orphaned orangutan baby is ready to meet the public . the first step was to teach acara to be gentle with the infant . ` she was young and spunky , so that was our biggest worry , that she would n't know what was too rough , ' said gordon . they plied acara with rewards . the more complicated the task , the higher-value the treat : from the everyday fruit to her favorite grapes and pomegranates to the foods she only gets on special occasions , like jello , granola , graham crackers , applesauce and peanuts . when acara had mastered being gentle , zookeepers gave her a stuffed animal to teach her how to pick the baby up , hold it and flip it over . the two were introduced when tuah was 3 months old , and for the last month , they have lived together full time , gordon said . acara has adjusted to child-rearing and will retrieve tuah for animal keepers and carry him between exhibits . she also helps tuah navigate the ropes and stops him from tripping on toys . on saturday , tuah spent a lot of time holding onto the ropes and occasionally wandered up to the glass , giving visitors outside the enclosure an up close glance . ` he stayed awake and fought off his nap until about 3:30 , ' hansen said . tuah 's father was eli , an orangutan who became famous for correctly predicting the super bowl winner seven years in a row . eli died of cancer in september , but officials hope tuah inherited his ability . ` tuah 's going to try it next year , ' gordon said . lost her parents : tuah 's father , now dead , gained national fame by correctly picking the super bowl winner seven straight years is ready to meet the public .
